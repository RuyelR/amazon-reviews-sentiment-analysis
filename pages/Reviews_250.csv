0,1,Worst Coffee tasted,I should've listened to the reviews. This coffee is terrible. I am not sure why Amazon still has this producat available. I ordered 4 boxes and cannot even give those away as people in the office also say it's terrible.
1,1,low carb pan cake mix,would not buy again.  The product did not cook all the way.  I tred it cookig with a high heat and a low heat.  The only way I was able to have it done in the center was to make crepes.
2,1,BLECH! BEWARE - the 5 star reviews must be bogus!,"My family is organic and gluten free and we have found genuinely tasty snacks, but this isn't one.  The taste is not ANYWHERE remotely close to real Cheetos. They actually tasted like they'd turned. They don't even look like the picture on the outside. I can't even imagine how someone else WOULD like them so I'm really thinking the rave reviews are fake. Or written by someone who's never had a real Cheeto.  ugh. I may give them to the squirrels out back but I might get charged with cruelty to animals. YES, THEY ARE THAT BAD."
3,1,overpowering lemon grass,"This tea sounded great. I lived in the middle east and love the real moroccan mint tea. The real tea includes spearmint and green tea only. Honey is typically added. In this case all you can taste is lemon grass and the only hint of mint is peppermint, not spearmint. I really regret buying a whole case of this stuff. I would highly recommend buying Twinnings green tea with mint. It doesn't have ""Moroccan mint"" as a title, but it is a lot closer to the original namesake. Stash has a little bit of false advertising going on here. It should really be called lemon grass green tea with a picture of lemon grass on the box. It is anything but Moroccan."
4,1,Made me SICK,I thought this would be awesome.... product didn't taste bad initially.... but cleaned me out.... and NOT in a good way... went to throw out the rest... and it defrosted but didn't lose it's shape in the sink!  That made me even more sick!  What in the world was in that product?
5,1,Cheesy Reissue,"My one-star refers to this so-called ""20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"" of this hilarious and eye-popping delight from director Tim Burton.<br /><br />Since the inception of the DVD format, I have been waiting for a proper DVD of Beetlejuice with commentary and special features.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that this pathetic disc is NOT what I have been waiting for.<br /><br />Though they supposedly have spruced up the picture, the ONLY special features are three Beetlejuice cartoons and I think some music track or something.<br /><br />NO commentary, NO behind-the-scenes, NO nothing.<br /><br />So -- NO sale.<br /><br />I'm still waiting..."
6,1,Sudo-bark,My word these are terrible.  Do people really eat these?  Each crunchy bite is a sudden new burst of bland and disgusting.  I think the only reason these things don't go bad is because even bacteria find them unpalatable.
7,1,Beware these nuts! Bitter Taste Lasts For Days!,"I thought this sounded like a great deal - I love pine nuts and the price was right.  Unfortunately, these pine nuts are imported from China and have caused me to have a lasting bitter taste in my mouth.  Others have reported a similar issue:<br />[...]. Save yourself some agony and buy the slightly more expensive pine nuts from the US or Italy."
8,1,Horrible,"This tea is horrible. The product has a dirty laundry smell and does not taste much better. I expected better from something so expensive. It is simply not worth it. Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi, H&S, and numerous other tea companies have better white tea. In all honesty, this tastes worse than bagged tea. Teavana has some good products, but they are just too overpriced.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern."
9,1,Don't buy this coconut milk!,"I have purchased other coconut milks (Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk, 14 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) from Amazon with good results, but that product is no longer available. So I bought this coconut milk hoping the other reviews were wrong. This coconut milk is terrible! Even after 24 hours in the refrigerator there was no separation in the can, and thus no coconut cream to be whipped and the coconut milk is very watery.  If you just want to throw this into the blender for shakes then it should be O.K., but if you are wanting creamy coconut milk, look elsewhere."
10,1,"Ordered July 26; received with pull date of July 13, 2012!","I recognize that the pull/use by dates on products are not ""throw this away now"" dates. However, when 12 packages of baby food are ordered AFTER the ""best by"" date, there is a real problem. I would not take the chance on ordering this product with this kind of stale dating, especially when a twelve pack is likely to last the typical baby several weeks or more.<br /><br />(Before noticing the expired date, we did try a bit of the food on a 10 month ""subject,"" who found the flavor acceptable. However, he eats all kinds of vegetables, without the need for sweetening them with fruit, so there seemed little need to do such ""sugar coating. In addition, the cost--and wasted packaging materials--does not compare well at all compared to his usual diet of home-cooked veggies from the garden and farmers market. They might be practical for travel emergencies, but otherwise, even when ""current,"" would earn no more than two stars.)"
11,1,Packaging quality problem,"""Both"" of Gloria Jean's ""Hazelnut"" and ""Vanilla"" packs of 50 contained only ""49.""  Does Gloria Jean's have a fundamental packaging problem ??"
12,1,"Buy American, this product is from China","There are two mainstream commercial sources of Xylitol - Corn and Hardwood trees such as Birch. Many rumors have circulated on the internet regarding the benefits and or drawbacks of either. Here you can gather the facts.<br /><br />The structure of Xylitol does not differ between corn based and birch based xylitol. However, it is a fact that the vast majority of corn based Xylitol found in North America is imported from China. Almost all imported Chinese Xylitol is derived from corn.<br /><br />Also a fact is that most commercial sources of corn itself are genetically modified. This is not true of birch trees.<br /><br />The process utilized in making birch based Xylitol is envirnmentally green and sustainable, in fact the process often uses caommercial scrap that may otherwise be discarded.<br /><br />So is Birch better than corn? You be the judge, each individual can make up their mind. Prices are almost the same, if the description doesn't say American birch you can assume it's Chinese corn."
13,1,gross,"i don't understand how people can drink this and say it taste like strawberry milk. it has a nasty medicine after taste. (yuck!) i prefer the french vanilla flavor. if you wanna try a strawberry protein shake that actually taste like strawberry milk, try gnc's lean shake strawberries & cream. that's good stuff plus it has more protein than special k's protein shakes."
14,1,"exactly, down the molecule, the same formula as Wal-Mart's Organic baby formula","Buyers beware of this rip off--the Earth's Best infant formula (and Vermont Organic) is produced by exactly the same manufacturer and are the same to the microgram.  Literally THE EXACT SAME STUFF just re-packaged and marked up 40-60%, depending upon where you are buying it.  Go with the Wal Mart Organic brand if you want this formula, because you're throwing your money away otherwise.  I was glad I'd only bought one can of the Earth's Best before I realized this!"
15,1,caramel,"I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel"
16,1,Stale,"I love this product!  I use it in granola which I make to avoid gluten, and as an unsweetened natural snack.  I was buying it the stores and they were running out a lot so then I couldn't get it for a while.  So I thought buying a case from Amazon was a great idea.  Unfortunately, when it got here it was very stale and I didn't eat it.  Amazon gave me my money back but I decided not to replace it.  I didn't eat the rest, I threw out the whole case.  Amazon said they were working with the manufacturer to eliminate the problem.  If you use a lot of it, give it a try.  Hopefully they got the problem sorted out and your case will be good.  This happened several months ago, just reviewing it now."
17,1,HORRIBLE,"I just wasted money on flavorless air.  Actually, they were disgusting and flavorless.  We tried all flavors and none were better than the last.  Don't waste your money, go buy some apples or something.  Yuck.  Wish I could get my money back."
18,1,Hot dishwater...?,"Never having consumed dishwater I can only imagine that Oregon Chai is what it might taste like.  Having had superb chai at my local Indian restaurants, I assumed (wrongly) that I wouldn't be able to recreate the exquisite experience that is an awesome cup of chai.  I found my exquisite cup of chai by chance ... literally picking a brand at random (Third Street Chai -- -- beyond awesome).  Then I tried Tazo Chai -- -- very average.  Then I tried Oregon Chai... this is the weakest, most tasteless chai I've consumed thus far.  It literally almost tastes like nothing.  I can barely detect the spices that are common in chai nor can I even taste the black tea!  I'm surprised at the 5 star reviews for this product.  If the 5 star reviewers were bowled over by something this tasteless, Third Street Chai would rock their socks and send them into the stratosphere.  Try Third Street, folks... way better than Oregon Chai."
19,1,Raccoon don't care,"I wasted the whole bottle of ""Critter ridder"" on a small lawn, which was overturned each night by a raccoon. I tried spraing on grass, then on the ground under the grass and bottom side of sod (that's where raccoon finds grubs), but it didn't care at all. Aparently, ""Critter ridder"" simply made his lunch spicy - that's all. It keeps coming back each night."
20,1,Made in China?!?!,Bought these at my local pet store not even thinking to look at where they're made (because everything in that place is usually super high quality stuff).  Came here to see what others think and that's when I saw the other reviews about being made in China - CAN NOT believe I bought these.  My dog has had one and now they're in the trash.  DO NOT give these to your dog!!!  0 stars
21,1,poor quality,"I drink tea everyday and was excited to find such a great deal on this tea.  Regrettably, the only good part about this tea was the price.  The tea tastes somewhat bitter and earthy and not in a good way and is weak also.  I will not buy this again and will stick to PG Tips or Yorkshire Gold."
22,1,Bitter after taste,"I am a hard core coffee lover, but have been having trouble with the caffeine so have decided to to try and find a good decaf.  I thought this might be the one but I was sorely let down.  The coffee smells pretty good but once brewed it has a very bitter slightly acidic after taste.  I even tried mixing it half and half with my other coffee but could STILL taste the bitterness.  Needless to say I have it sitting on my shelf and neither my sister nor I will be drinking it."
23,1,K-Cup foil not sealed and hot coffee spurts out all over,"We purchased two 24-count packages of Tully's House Decaf. Obviously something went wrong in manufacturing of these K-Cups.  After we began the brew cycle, very hot coffee came out over the top of the K-Cup and the compartment in many directions and only a portion of it went into our mug below.  Thinking it was only a problem with that one, we tried another.  When it happened again, we investigated more closely.  The foil seal over the top of the K-Cup is not complete.  Very hot water under pressure inside the K-Cup was forced up and out, along with coffee grounds, and sprayed quite a distance from the machine. Our Keurig is in the bedroom - what a mess!"
24,1,"Bags are the small 1 oz bags, not 'Big Grab"" bags!","The bags in this variety pack are not 'Big Grab"" bags as stated in the title. The value of this product is far less than it would have been if these were actually the much larger Big Grab bags. These small 1 oz. bags can be purchased for 20-25 cents each at various warehouse clubs. No bargain here."
25,1,Stale Granola Bars,"The Granola bars, with about a month left before being out of date, were stale, petrified and inedible.  I returned the product to the original seller.  Amazon charged double what the original merchant charged for the product.<br />All in all, a very disappointing experience.  I have bought from Amazon many times in the past and was always pleased with the merchandise.  This was the first ""FAIL"" for me."
26,1,Throwing away.,"I have purchased many varieties of protein cocoa's; however, this was the worst one I've tried yet. It had a funny flavor to it, and despite many attempts, I could not get the clumps to dissolve. I will be throwing the rest away."
27,1,Tastes like chemicals,"First, I would like to say that I purchased this product from the STORE, not from this seller. Also that there was not a problem with the expiration date of the coffee.<br /><br />I am not a picky coffee drinker. I like all kinds, but I prefer stronger brews. I like flavored coffee as well, but only when it tastes like what it is suppose to. I don't think anyone wants to drink chemical flavored coffee.<br /><br /> When I bought this product I thought it was going to be great, I am a consumer of folgers and have tried different flavors of theirs, however this was the first k-cup brand I bought from them and was VERY disappointed.  The coffee is definitely flavored and does taste like caramel, but after each sip there is an after taste of some sort of chemical.  The after taste is so strong and disgusting that you can neither enjoy the flavor of the coffee nor the caramel. For the first time was unable to finish my cup of coffee. To drink the entire cup would have been the equivalent of torturing myself.<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone buy this product."
28,1,Nutritious and... Ropey,"As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three ""issues"" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the ""rope"" & ""wet hemp bracelet"" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the ""organic"" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.  For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided."
29,1,Where Was This Manufactured/Produced>,"When this product arrived, I noticed that it said on the label that it is ""PACKED BY"" Honeytreehoney, but there is no information as to where it is produced. I emailed Honeytreehoney, asking them to supply that information but got no response. If you care where your food comes from (US, China, Etc.),you may not want to buy this. I won't reorder it. And I'm not sure I'll use it, either.<br /><br />The one star rating is simply an indication of my dissatisfaction for the information gap, not the taste/quality of the molasses."
30,1,what a disappointment!,"we bought our first eagerly awaited box of Zitner butter creams today [locally, not from AmaZON) Absolutely awful, no butter flavor whatsoever anymore.  Cost saving attempt by new owner?  Buyer Beware!"
31,1,Not Ground Coffee,I purchased this product thinking it was ground coffee.  Not so.  If you are looking for ground...look elsewhere.  This is instant coffee and not great at that.
32,1,Dogs didn't like,I have 4 standard dachsunds and 1 german shepherd and they hated these treats. I gave them away to my local vet.
33,1,Didn't even get to enjoy.... contains Carageenan,"While I can't truly speak regarding the taste as I wasn't even able to try the product. I have an allergy to Carageenan (Seaweed) and even though I took special care to determine the ingredient wasn't in there (even checked outside of Amazon)... it is unfortunately in there. So, now I have a case of this stuff that will get donated as I can't consume it. I really wish there was a way to determine this prior to purchase as this is the second time this has happened. =("
34,1,"Beware... It has ""hint of heat from chiles"" in it.","It is not fair to say I give this product one star as I haven't even tried it, but the label states that it has ""hint of heat from chiles"" in it. I can not eat anything with chile in it and would not have ordered it if it had been indicated on the web site. If you like a bit of heat you may love this and give it a 5star rating, just be aware."
35,1,leaks leaks leaks,no matter what brand of k-cup i used them with they leaked !! i even got the washers to put on them thats supose to stop leaks and that made them leak more out the sides of the rim ...
36,1,Tasteless!,"I used to get ""Juniper Ridge Juniper Ridge White Sage & Wild Mint Tea"" and LOVE it with a hint of raw honey and I wanted to give this tea a try. Very disappointed- the tea was tasteless and not what i had expected."
37,1,Not even close...,"This was a waste of money, the item was late, package was torn up,and the tea was terrible, not a good product in my opinion and bad handling."
38,1,stale & lacking in flavor,"I assumed that bulk purchases of this type would be fresh, drop shipped as a rule, but I have serious doubts now.  I have had the fresh gum, this isn't even close.  You could wear your teeth out chewing this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the few bad products, as received.  As usual, Amazon does an incredible job of processing, expeding & getting shipped-every time!"
39,1,Product Specifications,Product specifications list the country of origin as United States of America. Since when does Jamaican coffee grow in the USA?
40,1,Mountain Blend Coffee 4 Cup Filter Pack,"Coffee is very weak,I have to use 3 packs to make 4 cups of coffee."
41,1,DANGEROUS!,"As I was removing mayo from the jar with a tablespoon, I noticed a large hole in th bottom of the jar! I took out the shards of glass: they are no thicker than the glass one would find in a standard house lightbulb!! BEWARE! I have emailed the company and await their reply. Needless to say, I threw out my bowl of potato salad-in-the-making!"
42,1,Haven't received yet,I would like to be able to review this product but I still have not received it and it's been over a month.
43,1,Not happy at all,"Been taking Stevia in the Raw for over 3 months believing it would be healthier for me considering diabetes runs in my family.  Well foolish me got sucker by Stevia in the Raw.  In small print the word DEXTROSE.  What is Dextrose?  Is a HIGH Glycemic Index, fast absorbing carbohydrate derived from corn.  Percentage of Corn - Genetically Modified. And how about the HIGH GLYCEMIC INDEX, not good for diabetics.  Definately not purchasing this again.  Also from what've read Truvia is no better - alcohol sugars.  Guess back to the drawing board.  Hopefully I can find a product that only has STEVIA and no other ingredrients."
44,1,Gouging,Well it seems Prince of Peace has once again raised their price. A box of white tea and pu erh tea is now nearly THIRTY dollars to have shipped to you. Five dollars shipping per box plus the insanely raised price of 16.99. Apparently Dr Oz has created a lot of suckers who will pay this ridiculous price but I won't be. So much for good advertising of a product.
45,1,NOT good food,"Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!<br /><br />We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.<br /><br />We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />1. Good quality ingredients<br />2. Less supplements than some other brands<br />3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok<br />4. Affordable<br />5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money.<br />6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy<br /><br />P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well."
46,1,do not buy this product,"This item is literally $10 more than what you can buy it for at a store.  They sell it at Target for $3 or $4/box.  I mistakenly thought I was buying a ""bulk"" item because it was so expensive.  My fault.  But, when I asked about returning the product they said, sorry no, we believe this is a good price for this item, but if you would like we will offer you 10% off on a future purchase!  Hmm..., I don't think so.  Buyer, beware with this company, make sure you do your research first.  I did not and I payed the price."
47,1,good value,I am thoroughly enjoying my ground flax. It is very flavorful and blends easily into smoothies and yogurt. I have added some to cereal and hot oatmeal as well. The price is great. A real bargain. Highly recommended.
48,1,Tasteless,These beans have absolutely no taste to them. Be prepared to add butter/salt while cooking them (and completely ruining the health factor in the process) if you plan to enjoy them.
49,1,Where is the blue cheese??,"These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead."
50,2,"GINGER GROUND FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasonings",The ginger is not strong enough - have to put a spoonful to get the taste.Mccormick ginger is so  much better -just a pinch is enough.
51,2,Strange  taste,The wine has a horrible chemical rubbery after-taste. Presumably a result of the process which extracts the alcohol.
52,2,Not the best thing Kraft makes,"I can't really recommend this stuff at all.  The salad dressing is NOT included and they've changed the taste so much from their original, that you cannot even recognize it anymore.  I won't buy it anymore - I used to buy it almost weekly.  Come on Kraft, bring back the original!"
53,2,All I taste is nougat and peanuts.,"The taste of nougat and peanuts is overwhelming in this bar.  If you would like a ""healthier"" version of a Baby Ruth candy bar, this is it."
54,2,Eh.,"I gotta say I love the idea behind this product.<br /><br />That being said, this flavor was very disappointing.  I'd have preferred to try the unflavored plain one out first, but this was the only flavor they had.<br /><br />I'll start with the pros.<br /><br />1. It's cheap.<br />2. It's a better option than most packaged drinks.<br />3. There is a minimum of crap in it, as far as I can tell.<br />4. It has a low carbon footprint relative to other coconut waters.<br /><br />Now for the cons.<br /><br />1. It does not taste anything remotely like coconut water.  I would say it maybe has a slight bubble gum flavor to it, but not really.<br />2. Neon/florescent pink color.  It looks like I imagine a pink lemonade made by Crystal Lite to be.  Lose the color!<br />3. Not refreshing at all.<br />4. The zippy top on this package is a bit of a PITA.<br /><br />I would like to try the plain one before writing this product off entirely.  I really like what Big Tree Farms does, but until they make this a better product, I recommend staying away from this one."
55,2,Far from Fiji,"I purchased this product in the hopes of giving Fiji a run for it's money. I, however, was truly dissapointed. While not bad, I found this water to be more on par with all other bottled water. That is to say several steps below Fiji. And considering it costs more than Fiji, I must recommend sticking with the best... Fiji."
56,2,Did not work...for me.,"Kind of had the opposite effect on me.  A friend recommended I try 5 hour energy and use it to replace my morning cup of coffee.  If anything it actually made me tired and groggy.  I guess it has a different influence on each individual.  I would suggest trying one first, before buying in bulk."
57,2,Not really gummy or fruity,"These are coated in sugar which make them less gummy and kind of dry. They are very firm and chewy more than gummy. They have a lot of citric acid which makes them tart but there is no discernible fruit flavor in any of them. If you ate each kind with your eyes closed, you would not be able to tell one ""fruit"" from the other. Very very disappointed. Will be giving 11 bags away and not ordering any Haribo again."
58,2,It WAS my favorite...,"I have been ordering Big Train Vanilla and Spiced Chai for just over 2 years on Amazon's subscription.  It was so good and it rivaled the chai at my favorite coffee house (NOT Char-bucks).  I always LOVED it, and enjoyed a cup each morning as I braced for the coming day.  I did, that is, up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher, so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.<br /><br />The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai, so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.  That horrible flavor is still there, so I know it isn't related to the way it's mixed.<br /><br />I am very disappointed because, like I said, it was my favorite beverage in the morning.  After trying so many different things over the last 4 months, I have finally selected another brand to try out.  I hope it is as good as this one used to be."
59,2,Disappointing Mess,"Sorry to dash anybody's hopes here. I know the reviews are pretty glowing, but that does not match my experience. This litter is not good. The chunks are huge, which not only seemed to make it hard for my cats to use, but looked disturbingly like granola when tracked all over the room. And track it does... like crazy. Which defeated my reason for buying it. Thankfully, on a tip, I switched to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005D4NXI4"">Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Respiratory Relief Litter - 20 lb</a> and I highly recommend it. It clumps well, tracks the least of the six or seven litters I've tried, and as an added bonus is completely dust-free (since it's made for cats with respiratory problems). Hope that helps. I know what a frustrating process this search can be and am very glad to be finally done with it."
60,2,"""Arazona Vanilla"" is  ""Halaleveryday""",The Mexican beans that I ordered from Arizona Vanilla Co. came from a company called Halal Everyday. Halal means lawful or clean according to Islamic law. I am not Muslim and feel that failing to disclose the fact that food/food products are prepared according to religious laws that I do not accept is a fraud. Arizona should state that their products are Halal for the benefit of all their customers Muslim and non-Muslim.
61,2,BLand,"This did not really have a memerable flavor, it was  bland and I would not purchase it again..<br />PRefer the Special K cereals top this/"
62,2,harsh taste,"I found this mix to have a strong bean taste to it.  I tried it a couple of times.  First just the way the mix says, which I did not like the taste at all nor did my hubby.  The 2nd time I added some vanilla to the mix in which did give it a bit of a better taste and was something my hubby said he would eat.  For me over all just to much bean of a flavor and I will never by it again."
63,2,Definately not a Medium Roast Coffee! Too bold and bitter!,"Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff."
64,2,Thought it was a good idea,"I am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first.  But like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth.  And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didn't do that).  Nice idea but I don't think I will buy these again."
65,2,A Bland Type of Mush.,"Our son (one year old) now eats solid foods. What should we give him? Well, the doctor says he can have anything we eat, as long as he can handle it. OK. When we eat, he eats some of our stuff. He loves going to the neighborhood frozen yogurt shop, that's for sure. He enjoys refried beans in many Mexican places. He loved my split-pea soup with ham. Apple sauce is one of his favorite foods. When we go to the In 'n' Out Burger, he loves the french fries and parts of the burger, and I hesitate even to mention the chocolate shakes. Yum!<br /><br />In addition, my wife has picked up a variety of more traditional baby foods and many of those have been made by Gerber under the Graduates heading. This afternoon, he dined on one of the Graduates lil' entrees, specifically the Pasta Stars in Meat Sauce. This particular dining experience was an almost total failure. He ingested a couple spoons of the pasta sauce and then refused to eat any more. I gave him a few if the green beans. He took them in, a negative experience was recorded on his face and they came right back out. Hmmmmm. I wondered what the problem was. So, I took a spoon and ate the pasta sauce. It was bland and way overcooked but it didn't taste all that bad. I also ate the beans. They were severely overcooked. Both parts of the entree were cooked to the point where they resembled some type of mush. Well, after dining on french fries and hamburgers, no wonder he winces at these entrees. He needn't worry any more. He won't be getting any further Gerber's lil' entrees. My wife also noted that they were packaged in a #7 plastic container and she said she'd serve them no longer. Not all is bad about the Graduates items, however, our son loves the Crunchies and Wagon wheels.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
66,2,Product itself sucked,"Received the package fast and in great condition. The product itself however is sitting in front of me on a desk as a nice reminder of the $10+ I blew on a spray my cat dislikes so much that he no longer plays with the catnip filled banana toy he enjoyed just 30 minutes before I put this on it.<br />I really wanted this to work I had planned on spraying it on my sons pants as he walked around the house cuz frankly it would have been hilarious, but ohwell. :("
67,2,Too Much of a Good Thing,"It's a challenge to review food, since so much of it is a matter of taste.  Although I think some people will like this granola a lot, it wasn't for me.<br /><br />This is a high-quality granola, flavored with cocoa and coconut, with chunks of dark chocolate and freeze dried strawberries and berries.  The texture is excellent, and contrasts well with milk or yogurt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I thought there was way too much chocolate.  The dominant flavor is cocoa, followed by the oats, then the chunks of chocolate.  The berries are pretty sparse, and I couldn't detect the coconut.  As I said, it might be right for some people, but I found the cocoa aftertaste to be offputting and am not a fan."
68,2,Decent at best,"This Jerky is close, but not quite as good as good as other pre-packaged bags you can get at the gas station.  It's tender and substantial, so points there.  The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.<br /><br />Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't very good jerky."
69,2,Not Fresh - Watch out for some of amazon food lots,"Sun chips are good, but now many other healthy snacks are out and they have not improved this product. This was a large quantity but the expiration was in just 60 days and the box came smashed ?? I Love amazon but some of the food buys you got to take your chances that this is not first quality stuff."
70,2,A Bitter Pill,"I have to say that I really wanted to like these muffins, but I could not.  They have a really bitter after taste.  Whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, I do not know.  The Hodgson Mill Blueberry Muffin Mix is a far better choice.  On a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that I find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left."
71,2,Not as good as the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese,"Wow.  What a disappointment.  My son and I loved the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese, so I had high hopes for this alfredo sauce packet.  I thought it would be nice for a more grown up meal than the kid's mac version.  The first turn off (and again, totally different than the shells packet) was the aweful color. I've been a vegetarian for 25 years and a vegan for most of that, so I have a pretty high tolerance for these things.  The color was a very unappetizing greyish green, like sliced avocado that's been left out too long.  The smell and texture weren't very appealing either.  My husband will eat anything, he's a human garbage disposal, so he had no trouble with it.  But I doctored it up with some sauteed mushrooms, olive oil and a little almond milk for creamyness and it was a passable sauce on top of pasta.  But I was looking for a no fuss packet and ended up having to get creative and work with it.  I spared my son from having to eat it and opened a jar of marinara sauce for him.  I guess I'll use the rest of the packets as a thickening ingredient in sauces because they certainly aren't edible acording to the package instructions."
72,2,"Love Teas, Just Not This One","To give you a bit of background, I drink tea every single day, several times a day.  Not your typical American bag tea, but loose tea.  I like the variety of flavors available in loose teas.  I enjoy Rooibos and other herbal teas, White teas, Green teas, and Black teas.  Basically, I should own stock in Teavana since I drink so much of their tea.  I also found a phenomenal tea from Stockholm.  These teas are much better than your standard Orange Pekoe and Black or bagged teas in Starbucks or my local grocer.  That said, this product intrigued me and I figured I would give it a chance.  We only brewed it straight in our drip coffee maker.  No foam and such that was shown on the package...Here are the pros and cons we found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />*health benefits - but I get that with the teas I already drink<br />*seems easier to get more concentrated flavor (if you want that)<br />*Cappuccino or other methods could be good if you're trying to replace coffee with healthier alternative (I still would just opt for loose tea since the deep, rich flavor of coffee isn't ""there"" with this product.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*flavor was ok, a bit heavy, not spectacular (on the other hand, the teas I drink each day are complex, varied in taste, and refreshing)<br />*texture was off - usually I don't think of teas as having much of a texture but there was a definite difference due to the ground nature of this product - felt ""off""<br />*It reminded me of how creamed corn is the leftovers.  I wonder if the leaves used to make this were so small they were ground up in hopes of still making a profit.  I could be wrong or pessimistic..."
73,2,Too tart,"I make Crystal Light Lemonade at home in a pitcher and add some Ocean Spray Diet Cranberry to sweeten it and it's delicious.  When I saw this product it seemed like a great idea to have at work.  I was very disappointed.  It tastes too tart, not at all sweet.  It's basically lemonade.  I hope that they will reformulate this so that it has a sweeter cranberry taste. If I can do it right when I make it at home, they should be able to also."
74,2,Not as strong as I hoped,"I love chocolate coffee, I was hoping this would be strong but its not. It has a small hint of chocolate, nothing like my favorite Mud Slide ( Which smells my kitchen up with lovely chocolate/coffee smell! ) The coffee flavor is also very mild. I won't be buying again, not strong enough for me!"
75,2,Gone to seed,"I bought this product in December 2010.  It is at least 50-60% almonds, and I'm yet to find a hazelnut, despite re-mixing to overcome shipping segregation.  They used to be best on the market - now they're just another ripoff."
76,2,Disappointed,I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee.  I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get.  Two ounces of coffee for $8 is not a fair price.
77,2,Stale,"I recently discovered this product at a local grocer and loved the fresh tasting orange flavor, but the one I received from Amazon smelled of oiliness when a package is opened, and tasted stale...crunchiness of almonds were there but no orange flavor can be detected. So I was rather disappointed and will not order again."
78,2,Beware of the variety you buy,Cats are obligate carnivores.  They should eat 97%+ meat.  A lot of Weruva varieties are packed with veggies.  Veggies aren't good for cats.  Grains aren't good for your cat.  Knowledgeable cat nutrition friends think the Paw licking chicken is fine and their cats love it.  My cats and I hate the veggie-containing varieties they tried.  Look closely at the label before you buy.
79,2,yuck,I don't like diet coke but my husband does and it tastes just like it so if you like diet coke its for you lol
80,2,too bitter,"I like chocolate in my coffee.<br />But this chocolate is so bitter-sweet, you can't even taste it.<br />And it is really, really difficult to squeeze it out of the bottle.<br />Not gonna buy this again, that's for sure"
81,2,STASH LEMON GINGER TEA (CAFFEINE FREE),"I purchased due to one of the review saying this was much better than yoki tea,I feel this tea has a bitter taste and not much ginger,in fact I added ginger,which did not help the taste at all."
82,2,Bob,"We tried this blend and it really tastes like burned coffee.  I guess when we thought about it, Kahlua is a coffee flavor, so how can you have a coffee flavored coffee ?  Seems like the maker just roasts the living daylights out of these beans.  I am not sure who this flavor would appeal to."
83,2,The Fifteen Minute lasting treat.,"I got this for my Cairn terrier puppy when I first got him and I have to say, the idea is a good one but execution is poor. There are two basic problems with this toy.<br /><br />1) My dog just licks it until the treat gets smaller and then manages to pull it out and finish it. This takes maybe fifteen minutes at most.<br /><br />2) Even if he didn't do that, after about three uses the rubber became loose around the treat, so that now it basically just pops out by itself.<br /><br />So save your money and invest it in something more durable."
84,2,Didn't last long,The website for Himalayan says the dog chews should last 2-3 weeks. Um. no. My golden retriever blazed through 3 large sticks in under an hour. She LOVED em tho... But a taddy bit pricey for less than an hour worth of dog entertainment.
85,2,2yr in the making,I got this as a gift loved it...I even got everyone I know to buy one  after they used mine...BUt sadly after about 8months to a year my started to have problems cups were not filling all the way or no filling at all...I know alot of K cups are plugging and not allowing for full strength...then about the same time several people I know that have them had the same problem..I have the carbon filter and use a whole house water softener system so mineral deposits are not my problems....Search the internet this is a very well known problem..
86,2,does not work-causes loose bowles,I have been taking this for several days on the advice of my acupuncturist and it has not had any effect on my chronic muscle pain and also has caused me to have loose bowls when going number 2 in the bathroom.<br /><br />does anybody know of a product that can help get lactic acid build up out of muscles?
87,2,Not so good for you ???,"I bought this product because I wanted to eat a healthy cereal and at the same time add more fiber to my diet.  I chose All Bran because it did not contain aspartame.  I got home and started reading the ingredients & realized the second ingredient is sugar and also contains high fructose corn syrup. It has 8 grams of sugar per serving, but they list a serving as only 1/3 cup.  Who do they think they are kidding?  An average American eats more than that for breakfast.  Do they think consumers are stupid?<br /><br />A box of Kashi 7 Whole Grain Flakes with Black Currants & Walnuts cereal lists a serving as 1 cup and contains only 10 grams of sugar for that whole cup.  Uncle Sam cereal with Real Mixed Berries contains NO added sweetner of any kind and 1 cup of it contains only 2 grams of naturally occuring sugar coming mostly from the berries.  Wow!  You mean a cereal manufacturer is brave enough to make a cereal without adding sugar?  Yes and it is good.  In comparison eating 1 cup of All Bran Buds would be consuming 24 grams of sugar.  No thanks!<br /><br />If anyone at Kellogg's is reading this please know that people who are buying these types of cereals are not buying them primarily for the taste but for the health benefits.  We are not the ""Kindergarten Crowd"" who needs sugar added to everything to get us to eat it.  If I want to consume extra sugar I'll eat a cookie once in a while as a treat.  If I am going to eat a cereal everyday to incorporate fiber into my diet it is not going to be one that has unneeded amounts of sugar.<br /><br />Why can't the big name cereal manufacturers use stevia as an alternative sweetner?  It has been used for years in Europe with no known side effects. The consumers buying these types of cereals who are trying to watch their sugar consumption and increase their fiber would gladly welcome less or preferably no sugar or a healthy sweetner such as stevia."
88,2,Not what I expected,"The beans I received were dry, split and only a little fragrant.I had not bought any for a while, so I bought some others to compare and these are definitely inferior."
89,2,Its okay,Tried this coffee for the first time when I got it from a friend. Nope. Not going there again. I found it too bitter and it tastes like its namesake.
90,2,Disappointed with this tea.,"I am disappointed with this tea. I am used to Indian black tea such as Assam or Darjeeling.<br />This tea has no aroma and tastes pretty dull, nothing compared to the aroma and tastes you get from Indian tea. The quality of the product is great; good beautiful long leafs, but if you are used to Indian black tea then this would not give you the same experience."
91,2,not my favorite chicken substitute,"after reading al the reviews, i tried this product and do not like the consistency. I found that if i cook it in the microwave for a few minutes before using in recipes it is slightly more palatable. this is not my favorite chicken substitute - prefer the fri chik over this product."
92,2,Better than bullion but worse than the Custom Culinary's,"We hadn't been able to find our favorite lobster base at Surfas, LA.  They've been out of stock since the first of the year.  So, following the reviews here, I bought a jar of Better than Boullion lobster bast, $6.19 at Bristol Farms.  Tasted it:  It's not good, no way can it be compared with Custom Culinary's. With only a hint of lobster, dark red color, and tasting strongly of tomato paste, it won't do here.  Surprisingly, Better than Boullion has an excellent chicken base and their ham base if good too.  Had I looked farther down the page, I would have noticed that Amazon also carries the Custom Culinary ""Gold Label"" lobster base, which is the brand we had been using.  Yes, it's more than 3 times as expensive, but a bigger jar, much less need be used at one time, and the flavor is a world of improvement...really tastes like lobster and enhances everything from fish chowder to thermador."
93,2,Wasabi?,"I love wasabi, even the horseradish version that is usually passed off. This stuff is so weak, I can not consider it in the same family of either. I added a teaspoon to an 8 ounce can of nuts and had very little effect. I tried another, still with minimum effect.<br />Go with the paste. That stuff kicks tail!<br /><br />Ben"
94,2,"""Medium"" roast???","I recently purchased an 11 oz. bag of whole bean Seattle's Best Level 3 coffee.  The bag described it as a ""medium"" roast.  As I don't care for the usually burnt, bitter tasting darker roasts I previously tried, I thought I'd give this a try.  When I first opened the bag, I was struck by the very dark appearance of the beans and a burnt odor.  I was skeptical that I would care for this coffee at this point, but decided to try it anyway.  Unfortunately, my fears were confirmed when I actually tasted the coffee -- first black and then with sweetener and milk.  The bitter, burnt taste was very pronounced and this was at less than half the recommended brew strength, i.e., 3 level tablespoons for 8 cups.  If this is in fact ""medium roast"" coffee, I really don't want to know what the ""dark roast"" is like. I will not be buying any more Seattle's Best coffee."
95,2,"Novel idea, but needs work","I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
96,2,Very strong taste,"I am not a coffee snob, but I find this strong is very strong in flavor.  I use the large cup selection on my maker and combine it with a cup of regular coffee.  I think it might be ok over ice."
97,2,useless - I feel no effects whatsoever,"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry."
98,2,Original PopChips,"Bought the Original flavor from the store and just tried them tonight. They were very greasy and salty. I did not like them a lot. I will not purchase this original flavor again. However I can't complain because I got the 3 ounce bag for only $1.00 at the store while they were on sale. I tried the BBq flavor and they are delicious. I bought the sea salt & vinegar, and cheddar but haven't tried those yet."
99,2,Poor Quality,"This item comes in a pkg of 3 bags.  The first one was like dust.  It even smelled like dust when I ground the beans, no coffee scent at all.  I just opened the 2nd bag and it does smell like coffee, and much better taste too, but it's so not worth having to throw away an entire bag.  That makes the cost per pound way more than this coffee is worth."
100,3,Pleasant but nothing to get excited about,"I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website. The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the ""floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish"" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job."
101,3,NEAT BUT TOO SMALL.,"NEAT LITTLE PRODUCT. SEEMS TO SHIP ONLY IN THE FALL, WINTER AND SPRING. HOWEVER, I PREFER OTHER BRANDS WHICH HAVE LARGER BOTTLES. THESE ARE DINKY."
102,3,Decent coffe but not for the stronger coffee lovers.,"This coffee brewed up nicely.  However I love a nice strong cup and found this coffee too weak for me.  If you are looking for a midrange coffee, I would recommend trying this.  By if you are like me and need something stronger, this coffee is not for you."
103,3,Bold coffee but flavor is less than desirable,"Well, the description is accurate. This coffee is very bold, which is good for a morning pick up. However, it really does taste like jet fuel! It also leaves a very strong after-taste. Won't order this flavor again."
104,3,Early expiration date.,"I ordered this 6-pack of rice in November.  It arrived with a ""best by"" date of January.  Even though I'm sure I could eat it after its ""best by"" date, it's still too soon in my opinion, considering that I'm buying in bulk."
105,3,Not too shabby.....,"I was expecting the Black Cherry SWITCH to taste more like Black Cherry, but a quick check of the ingredients shows that my taste buds were correct, it is, indeed, a mixture of Apple, Grape, and Cherry juice. The taste is pleasant enough, but I wish it had more Cherry juice thrown into the mix. As it stands, it tastes like a carbonated juice box. The can is small (8.3 FL OZ), and the calorie count is HIGH- 130 calories per serving! Also, the carbonation level isn't very high, so there's no real ""fizz"", like you'd get from a soda. With a little fine-tuning, they might have a winner here (Bigger can, lower price point, more Cherry juice, more carbonation); As it stands, it tastes like a semi-flat can of Seltzer with some Apple juice poured into it. Not bad, but I doubt I'd buy it again."
106,3,This is DarK Chocolate?,"I was somewhat disappointed with this item. I expected it to be more chocolate-y. The outside coating is the usual dark chocolate coating that thinkThin uses on its other bars. The problem was that the interior detracted from the intense chocolate taste that I expected. It was muddled and weak. With this warning in mind, I have to say that it's better than other bars that I've tried from other companies. So, I don't want to discourage people from trying them. I'm a real chocolate person and I want an intense chocolate taste."
107,3,She eats it but it's like pulling teeth,"I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food.  She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her.  She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast."
108,3,Not a good Replacement,"The drink is not something I would ever pay to drink. I couldn't even finish the whole can. It has the fizz of soda but doesn't quite taste right. It's not exactly bad tasting, just not good tasting either. I can't say I would ever replace any drink with this one."
109,3,It's ok - but nothing new here,"There is nothing new with this product.  If you have ever used any of the shampoos from Head & Shoulders, you already know what to expect from this product.  The only real difference is the fragrance which is not enough of a differentiator to make me say ""this is great - you need to try this"".  It all comes down to  - do you like the fragrance which I can not comment on here.<br /><br />Overall - it's ok, but I won't be running out to replace it when the bottle goes empty."
110,3,Beary sticky situation,"I myself do like these but others may wish to take note. These bears are not sweet tasting at all. They are slightly chewy and really very sticky so if you have dentures, loose teeth or just don't like things sticking to your teeth you may want to pick something different. Would not be good for small children either."
111,3,Pate,"Actually they were not real goose liver,they are pork liver pate.Of course goose liver is more expensive!Taste's OK for me though delivery fee is too high!Unacceptable because they're from NY(inside US);"
112,3,Take note,"I was a bit confused as to why there were two very similar listings for Arrowhead Mills Shredded Wheat. Since this particular listing had a slightly lower price per ounce, I ordered it. It turned out to be sweetened shredded wheat. (Sweetened with ""evaporated cane juice,"" according to the label.)<br /><br />Not a problem for me -- in fact, it's quite a tasty snack -- but people might want to know.<br /><br />So deducting two stars in rating is for omitting ""sweetened"" in the listing, not for the product itself."
113,3,They are ok.,They taste more like raisins to me. Has the texture of a gummy but a bit tougher than most so recommend with a toddler with great chewing abilities.
114,3,"Great Product, Bogus Price","These are very good nut bars, far superior to anything that you can buy from the big food conglomerates. Wonderful for breakfast or anytime you feel like some nuts. Lightly sugared, so not overwhelming in that department.<br /><br />However, I can buy a box of 24 bars for $16 locally. So this is not something you want to buy from Amazon unless you are house-bound and have no other way to get them, or you can't find a local store that carries them. Hint: look at alternative markets, not at your standard cookie-cutter supermarket.<br /><br />So three stars for a great product that is grossly overpriced in this venue."
115,3,PIMS ORANGE,"This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU ""Petit Beurre"" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer."
116,3,My cats love this smelly fish,"My 2 cats are picky tuna lovers and this was all that was available at the time. They still love this, but the smelly fish scent is very strong and the kitchen smells for a bit after they eat it. They still love it. But I don't like the smell. I'd buy it again if there was no other choice. But if there is tuna, I'd go for that instead."
117,3,Too Weak For My Taste,"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though."
118,3,Target and BJs carries it cheaper,"I recently started supplementing with Similac Advance and find its taste matches the closest with breastmilk. My baby hated Enfamil/Gerber. However, I found BJs carries this a lot cheaper at $28 for a 34 oz can compared to $40 per can here. The price difference is HUGE and not sure why someone would buy this from here. Even target carries the formula a lot cheaper. Amazon seems to have missed the price competitiveness on such a widely used product."
119,3,"Not bad, just not as good as expected","I had been getting Taster's Choice Columbian but they now only make in single servings which can get a bit pricey.  So I decided to try this.  Not bad, just don't like nearly as well as the Tasters Choice, so when I use an instant, I just cough up the money to get the individual ""sticks"" of it."
120,3,Value,Great product. Tastes just like regular pasta.. though takes a few minutes longer to cook.<br /><br />Price is expensive. Walmart carries this for $2.18. I could pay a little more for the convenience.. but not 5 bucks.
121,3,Weak coffee,"It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee. The box contains 15 pods. Though there's plenty of organic ads and blurbs on the box, there was not one line of instruction. I followed the suggestion on the product page here, and used my drip coffee maker with 8oz of water. The coffee was way too weak. I think using half the water amount would work better."
122,3,Lemon Drops,"The lemon drops were as expected but the took so long to get here that they missed the party for which they were intended.  We ended up having to buy some at the local store.  I guess we will snack on these for Halloween, instead."
123,3,Great flavor!,"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes."
124,3,Nice scent but gritty texture,"This Dove product has a nice clean smell, not too sweet or fruity (like many of the other men's body washes). However, the lotion in my bottle had a very gritty texture, which was off-putting."
125,3,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be,"I thought this would've tasted better than it did. Smelled stronger than it tasted. Wouldn't buy again. It's not bad, just not what I was hoping for."
126,3,Not my favorite but pretty good,"I drink a lot of Earl Grey tea and have tried four or five brands over the years, Bigelow being my favorite.  I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic."
127,3,Better for medium/large dogs,"It is fun for my toy poodle, but the yellow ""caps"" are too large for him to get his mouth around to remove them. He does enjoy moving the ""cover"" around so he can retrieve the treats."
128,3,Deep rich flavor,The blend is very strong and full flavored.  I was expecting more of a French roast flavored blend.  This coffee is the harshest I have tasted.  If you like a coffee that is super dark and will give you a kick this is the one for you.  I'll finish this batch and try the French roast next.
129,3,mastifflady,"I bought this product for my mastiffs and while is took them a couple of hours to eat it, it only took 20 minutes for my Boston to eat it. I was hopeing that it would last months not minutes or hours. Great product for light chewers and for dogs with allergies to meats."
130,3,Too big for small breeds,"I have a chihuahua and while he did take this and try to eat it, it was just too big for his little mouth.  The treats are too hard to break into pieces and he wasn't all that interested enough to chew the bigger pieces.  Though I will have to say my dog has never been the dog biscuit type so that could be part of the reason he didn't enjoy it.  It's a good quality product made from great ingredients, but not every dog is going to like it obviously."
131,3,Like watered down & weak Turkish coffee,"I drink my coffee strong.  The 3 ounce sample I received of this product wasn't nearly enough quantity for me to give it a real taste test, as I use twice that amount of coffee to make my morning brew.  Keep that in mind if you also drink your coffee strong: the 3 ounce packets are small.<br /><br />I am a Folgers fan.  It has a full-bodied flavor that is rich and satisfying to me.  So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it."
132,3,Can't offer much guidance,"I ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children.  Unfortunately, there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the Fall semester.  Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value, I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too!"
133,3,stale,"The package arrived ontime and as described.  The reason I ordered online was that it was not available in local stores and it is my favorite gum.  Unfortunately, it was a bit old and stale. Fresh date was in a month, which for individually wrapped gun it should have been a year or more.  Found a new supply and will order there from now on."
134,3,"My gerbils ate it, but not with gusto","I decided to try this food because it's organic and has less processed ingredients than most other gerbil mixes, but my gerbils weren't as impressed as I was. The seed mix isn't as boring as a lot of commercial mixes, but apparently the millet and alfalfa pellets (a large proportion of the mix) weren't appealing enough, since I always found a lot of them left over when I cleaned the tank. I'm not sure how hamsters would enjoy this food, but I probably won't be buying it again for my gerbils."
135,3,un-orangy,I really like the fact that this company wraps their cookies in serving size portions.<br />i wish these had more of an orange flavor to them
136,3,Didn't work for me but worth a shot,"This did nothing for me, as far as I could tell...  and I was drinking 5 bags a day.  But on the plus side, the flavor wasn't too bad - I wouldn't pick it over one of my favorite teas just for drinking, but with a little turbinado sugar and milk, it was quite tolerable - unlike some medicinal teas I've had!  I am not a fan of licorace and feared this would be nasty to drink but it wasn't bad.  Worth a shot - great if it works for you, but if it doesn't, there are other things to try.  (Motherlove tintures seemed to boost my supply very well when this tea and fenugreek capsules didn't work)"
137,3,Vinegar... Not my taste!,This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
138,3,Cheerful Flavor,This is a very 'cheerful' vanilla but lacks the dignity and character of Nelsen-Massey's Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract.  I'd suggest using it when baking with kids.
139,3,Bitter!,"I had high hopes for this coffee based on the reviews but was let down.  I picked up a can of this to have on hand incase I ran out of fresh beans for my grinder and I'm glad that I didn't get the 4 pack!  Perhaps I got a bad batch since the reviews here are mostly positive but I found this to be incredibly bitter when making espresso in my Rancilio Silvia.  I varied my dose, tamp, extraction time and temperature but nothing got rid of the horrendous, bitter/sour taste.  After several unsuccessful attempts I pulled a shot using my fresh ground beans to see if I was doing something wrong and had a great shot right off the bat.  Go figure.  On the positive side the grind is fine and even enough for an unpressurized portafilter.  This stuff may be fine for other brewing methods, I didn't try them, but I can't recommend it for espresso unless you really like bitter shots.  Perhaps I just like a darker roast, in the end I tossed it as I was unable to brew a drinkable shot."
140,3,"Not a good value, but tasty","The packs are really small. I thought I was saving by buying in bulk, but it was not a lot for the money.  As usually the beef jerkey tastes great."
141,3,Ok but Miss Vickie's Are Better,Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.
142,3,Not the best,"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short."
143,3,SWEET,"My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say. You're better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but it's too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors."
144,3,Okay,"This product tastes okay, but is definitely quite sweet.  Maybe I missed something, but I couldn't find the calorie content prior to ordering and foolishly ordered any way.  One review I read said there is 60 calories, but it is 80 calories a cup per the packaging, I probably wouldn't have ordered.  This will be a one time per day drink...also has a bad aftertaste.  On a positive note, the pricing is reasonable...however with one a day, it is going to take me two months to go through this drink that I am not crazy about."
145,3,Incorrect Order,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BCC"">Royal Oak  Gourmet Virginia Raw In Shell Peanuts, 2.5 Pound Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />I'll appreciate your speedy deliver of my package, however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell.  This item is going into a gift basket for my Pastor because he love raw peanuts in a shell.  I don't have time to returned them for the requested product. You have always been prompt with my orders in the past and I really do appreciate.  This is the first time you sent me an incorrect product.  I'll make it work."
146,3,not what I expected....,"Probably my fault, should have read the description more carefully.  The taste is hard to swallow... strong and bitter."
147,3,More like Tangy & Creamy,"Taco Bell has introduced a new line of three ""Bold & Creamy"" sauces. Each of the ""Bold & Creamy"" sauces are based on soybean oil, water, vinegar, buttermilk,  and a few other standard ingredients. Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce adds tomato to the primary recipe. Unlike the other two, this sauce has no peppers of any kind in its ingredients.<br /><br />The Spicy Ranchero Sauce has no perceptible heat, but the tang of the vinegar is much more noticeable than in the other varieties, especially if you use it as  dipping sauce. As I mentioned in one of my other reviews, I don't care for creamy sauces on my tacos. I did try the Spicy Ranchero Sauce on a couple of Taco Bell tacos, but still would choose one of the traditional red sauces.<br /><br />I made a sort of salad with celery, carrots, BBQ chicken strips, and tortilla strips. I used the Spicy Ranchero Sauce as a dressing and found it a good fit for this set of ingredients that was limited to what I had on hand at the moment. I've also used it as a dip for tortilla chips and vegetables. It occurred to me that it might be good on fish or shrimp tacos. I tried it on a Filet-O-Fish instead of tartar sauce. The fish flavor completely overwhelmed the Spicy Ranchero Sauce. I also tried it in place of seafood cocktail sauce with some cooked shrimp. It did not really add anything interesting to the shrimp.<br /><br />In my kitchen, the Spicy Ranchero Sauce is more likely to find use as a dressing or dipping sauce than a taco sauce.<br /><br />One note: the ""Best if Used By"" date on the bottle I received was a little over two months after I received it. This seems kind of short to me for a bottled product that's refrigerated after opening. It may have been an older lot, but it's something to keep in mind if you're thinking of ordering in bulk or taking advantage of a sale."
148,3,Not much blueberry,This is just like many breakfast cereals like Honey bunch of oats at the supermarket.<br /><br />This one is in a resealable plastic bag with a ziplock style closure.<br /><br />The taste is good with vanilla flavoring. There were no blueberries but just some tiny blueberry fragments.
149,3,"Love the Cashews, but a little Salty","I like the Emerald brand nuts. The canister is very convenient and easy to take along. I was a bit leery about the salt and pepper flavor. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I was mainly concerned that the pepper would be too strong. I actually found the salt to be a bit overwhelming. As I got closer to the bottom of the canister, the salt taste became stronger and the nuts at the bottom were very salty-almost inedible. If you love cashews this is a nice change from just salted as the pepper gives the nut a little ""kick."""
150,4,Great challenge...,I think the design is great for this treat delivery toy.  The large puck shaped things are too easy for my dog to remove so I load one of those and some dog biscuits into the ball once he gets the puck out I take that away.  Too much treat at one time for him.  He doesn't mind cause I think he likes his biscuits better anyway.  After tonight's 4 mile hike he is still into his everlasting... stuffing it with his normal biscuits keeps him entertained and preoccupied. He has brought it to me tonight about three times.  Each time I say Yep there is more... and toss it back to him...
151,4,Earl Grey,A very good product for the money. Affordable nice tea. Tea is getting so expensive that it's nice to have a good tea that doesn't break the bank.
152,4,Great for traveling,"I brought them for my trip to Europe. The hotels in Europe usually have a kettle, but only instant coffee power. It was wonderful to be able to have a real cup of coffee in my room! It's also organic.<br /><br />I would prefer it to be a bit stronger, but over all this is a great product for traveling and camping. I'll definitely buy them again."
153,4,Cyclone certainly bold...Fuggetabout it Bold-less,"Ordered Fuggetabout it and while it is a decent tasting coffee, it is far from bold or dark roasted enough. I was looking for reasonable k-cups, but this is not an item I'd purchase again even at a lower price.<br /><br />I was IMPRESSED with Brooklyn Bean Roastery's response!  They sent an order of Cyclone at no cost...and it was a full order not a 6-10 kcup sample!  They followed up to see if I was happy with Cyclone.<br /><br />Cyclone was very good and I'll order more.  The cups have brewed perfectly each time.  I've seen some comments that weren't positive, but the company seems to be working hard and it's worth trying."
154,4,A smooth and flavorful French Vanilla roast,"I'm not a fan of flavored coffees, but I enjoyed this one. Coming out of the bag, the smell is chocolaty and the vanilla aroma is very strong and pleasant. It produces a coffee that is smooth and creamy, with a thin layer of fine froth at the top when I made it in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264FT9K"">Bodum French Press</a>. I like my coffee piping hot with Half & Half and 3 sugars. The sweetness really brings out the vanilla flavor. Drinking it black, however, there's not much flavor to write home about. Without sugar and cream, it doesn't taste like either coffee or vanilla.<br /><br />The grind is extra fine. I was pleased by the small amount of the dust that passed through the Bodum and into my cup. For French Vanilla lovers, this is a very good price for 3 bags of coffee. The only gotcha is that it is ""Naturally and Artificially Flavored"" and not all natural. It tastes good, however. Lastly, the product is kosher, as indicated by the U symbol on the bag."
155,4,"Smooth taste, without the jitters - for Flavia owners only","A couple of years ago, my friends showed us the Flavia machine and then gave me a taste of how good a cup of coffee it could make. We immediately went out and bought one and have enjoyed using it ever since. While I have tried all of their different blends, we have settled on the House Blend as our daily brew. My wife can only drink de-caf and I find that the difference in taste between regular and the ""un-leaded"" is beyond my meager taste buds ability to tell the difference.  Especially since I usually put in sweetener and milk.<br /><br />The taste is smooth but with a good body. The blend has a good just-brewed coffee aroma but can be sharp and intense if you stand close by the machine as it steams out a cup. I have not tried to drink it black but I have sipped it with just half & half and it's quite nice.<br /><br />If you have a Flavia machine and want to cut down on the caffeine you drink, you will be pleased with the decaf house blend.<br /><br />4 and not 5 stars because I don't love the sharp aroma at brew time."
156,4,Not exactly powder,Not powder is a more appropriate heading. This product is more like large grandules.  I say that because if you're looking for powdered this isn't it.  Nonetheless this works quite well. A rating of 4 for the product description and a 5 for the product itself.
157,4,Pleasant tasting,"After I read all the positive reviews I had to try some.  It is very good just on toast.  Pleasant taste, not to sweet or sour.  I will have to experiment trying it on a few different things as suggested in some of the reviews."
158,4,good but were better in my memory,"these are good but tasted better in my memory. If they roasted the nuts, they'd be awesome. The nuts in these don't appear to be toasted/roasted before hand. Lots of whole nuts though."
159,4,Creamy & Delicious...but...,"Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice."
160,4,Good stuff,"A consistently good, bold brew. One of my favorites by far. It has flavor reminiscent of chicory, and just about, but not bitter. On the auto delivery program, can't beat the price. Try one with a Cafe Escapes Mocha added. Giddy up!"
161,4,Thats not bad!,"I got this from a local store, so nothing to say about delivery.<br /><br />I told a story about how I felt and got this in my review of the Zevia cola, so I won't rehash it here. Yes, I just plugged something for which I make no money.<br /><br />When I got it home, I noticed that one of the cans in the case wasn't Zevia but Blue Sky Free root beer. It was okay, but it also says something about how this stuff is packaged.<br /><br />Anyway, I let it chill and popped open a can, expecting something like Mug root beer but less so. It was actually pretty damn good, better than expected! The diet-y flavor is quickly overpowered by one that is decidedly root beer and only makes a brief cameo after the stuff is swallowed. While I would far rather have an A&W or Barq's, this is a very viable alternative if sugar and corn syrup are no longer your friends.<br /><br />The only real downsides I noticed is that there is no vanilla in it, instead it uses four kinds of oil extracts for flavor. Vanilla would have made it a five-star drink and if I have this stuff and some vanilla at the same time, I'll probably combine them.<br />Also, since I kind of assumed (I didn't look, sue me) this would cost a fortune to ship and handle, I found it locally. In the entire area of Arlington Texas, there are four places that sell this according to the Zevia stie. Four.<br /><br />Should you buy some? Sure. It lacks some of the satisfaction of more widely-available root beers, but 'diet' is Latin for 'nothing is as good as it could be'. Good alone, serviceable with Mexican food."
162,4,"Tasty, but messy","These are very good, but too messy to eat alone as a snack.  The blueberries stained my fingers and mouth.  They are very good mixed with yogurt or in muffins.  Normally, they are a little pricey, but with the instant rebate, they are well worth the cost."
163,4,I am not a fan of flavored coffee but I like this,This is a nice treat.  We served it with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Yum!!!
164,4,"Overall, Pretty Tasty","This two reviews, one each for two different flavors of KIND HEALTHY GRAIN CLUSTERS.<br /><br />The first review is for KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS and is rated at FOUR STARS ****.<br /><br />Pretty Tasty<br /><br />I am always looking for healthy, low fat, good tasting breakfast cereals so I thought that I would give KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS a try.  And, you know what?  I was pleasantly surprised.  In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS is a tasty, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.  And guess what else?  Our kids, ages 6 and 14, like it, too!<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium.  It is 100% whole grain cereal, made up of amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  1/3 of a cup is about 120 calories.  (However, 1/3 of a cup seems a bit small to me...)<br /><br />As I said, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS makes a nice, light breakfast for my entire family.  And my kids like it with vanilla yogurt and fruit, too, which makes a nice snack that even a mom can approve of.<br /><br />The second review is for KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS and is rated at THREE STARS ***.<br /><br />Not Bad<br /><br />I am always looking for healthy, low fat, good tasting breakfast cereals so I thought that I would give KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS a try. And, overall, it wasn't too bad. Not my favorite of the KIND HEALTHY GRAINS brand, but definitely edible. In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS is an acceptable, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium. It is 100% whole grain cereal, made up of amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds. 1/3 of a cup is about 130 calories. (However, 1/3 of a cup still seems a bit small to me...)<br /><br />As I said, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS makes a decent, light breakfast for my husband and me. My kids did not care for it, but that did not surprise me. I have added raisons, cranberrys, strawberries, etc to, and that helps a lot, but still, it is not my favorite, as compared to other KIND HEALTHY GRAINS choices."
165,4,Great variety for new Krieg owners,"Wonderful variety for new Krieg coffeemaker.  Lots of variety to choose from.  Some fluffy coffees, standard coffees, teas, hot chocolate.  Great variety.  Lots of variety in the coffee companies as well.  Gives us an idea what to buy next.  Thank you."
166,4,Best I Could Find,"Compared to the several other baby formulas we've tried, this is the best one. My son has reflux issues, even at 10 months old. This formula is thick enough that he doesn't spit up as often. It helped him maintain his weight when the reflux was worse.<br /><br />Organic is mandatory for my son's food. What I don't like is one of the ingredients. They use corn syrup solids to meet the necessary carbohydrate requirements. When I asked why they used corn syrup as opposed to something healthier, I received several automated responses stating that the number I gave them was incorrect. I had never given them a contact number, and my reply was to the first email they sent that stated the corn syrup solids were for carbohydrate requirements.<br /><br />Beyond that I haven't come across a better formula. This package of 4 is the best price I can find, as I live in HI and can not receive certain items or discounts via subscription and Amazon Mom."
167,4,Does the job,"When I travel to Africa it is difficult to get good coffee.  I am not a fan of the Nestle instant coffee that is available.  I take VIA to give the instant coffee a bit of a better taste.  Of course nothing beats coffee beans and my espresso maker at home, but it does the job."
168,4,Suprised by how good it is,"I'm an avid coffee drinker, but I stick to the basics: lattes, french roast drip,  espresso. Only rarely do I drink coffee with flavor added. But when I do, it's typically vanilla, so I thought this might be a decent product to have on hand during the holidays as an addition to my usual dark-roast, whole beans.<br /><br />I am drinking a cup as I type this and it's really good. The coffee itself has the full-bodied, robust taste I like. The vanilla flavoring is subtle and pleasant. It doesn't taste artificial and leaves no after taste. It's definitely a nice change from my usual coffee and feels festive.<br /><br />The Amazon price for two bags seems reasonable to me for Starbuck's coffee. Yes, it may be more expensive than other brands, but I think it's worth the delicate balance of flavors you get from the product."
169,4,Truly Sour,Other candy claimed as sour usually are not. Extreme Warheads is one of the leaders in lemon quality bitter sourness!
170,4,Great for Low Carb Diets,"These sticks are good to carry with you in your breifcase for when you want a snack, but are watching out for carbs."
171,4,Good Tea with Hibiscus Flowers,"****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, juicy, red fruits"".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other teas such as Numi, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****"
172,4,"Not your average chip, but decently tasty","This might not fill a craving for ""chips"" but if you don't go in expecting that, these aren't bad.  And the nutritional info on these is great.  They are much more filling than other similar calorie snacks."
173,4,Great,I was wondering if these would be any good and I am glad I tried them. Easy to make and taste like your in a morning cafe on a chilli morning. I am addicted to these they are a new part of my morning must
174,4,cars cupcake ring favors,the rings were great for the cupcakes and went perfectly with Lighting McQueens cake that I made for a baby shower the kids that were there really liked getting a little gift with their cupcakes some ate more than one so they could get a different ring
175,4,They like them!,My kids don't drink a lot of milk.  They don't like it.  They DO however like Chocolate milk.  I hate the mess of chocolate syrup though.  I bought these thinking that maybe it would be a good way to get some milk into them.  I honestly didn't think they would like them however.  I was pleasantly surprised when they asked for more!
176,4,Delicious and Barely Salty,"Bought four of these to have shipped to my diplomatic address in Brazil. They arrived in great shape.  Just about 3% of the nuts are impossible to open with the fingers, so I use a nut cracker (or donate to the birds here).  Delicious, and not overly salty. So I sometimes have to add some salt!"
177,4,Great for the convenience,"Thai tea brewed fresh in a restaurant is always going to taste better. For something convenient out of a package, this is pretty good. I like having it on hand for a treat, because brewing authentic Thai tea from the powder is very annoying and I've never quite gotten it right. Some people may find it a bit sweet."
178,4,Gems?,"They arrived very well packaged and they taste great! However they are not ""Gems"" as the packaging on Amazon shows. In fact my packages didn't have gems anywhere on it, and neither do they resemble the other products I have bought that were gems. All that means is they don't melt in your mouth the way gems do, but they are still excellent!"
179,4,"Organic, BPA free","We buy almost anything we can find in BPA free cans.  There is very little available.  These peaches taste ok but sometimes the color is off.  Recently, we got a shipment that had a slight green color.  The cans were dented, so maybe something was off.  Amazon is always good about refunds and replacements, so we're still happy and stick with Amazon because of their policies."
180,4,works well,this stuff works great however it took almost three weeks to make it to my house. its very tastey and it smells wonderful
181,4,A very good brand.,"DE is a very good coffee.  I ordered this as my father-in-law raved about it, and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee.  It tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it.  Very unique and very tasty.  I tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a 'medium' coffee, and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees.<br /><br />If you are a coffee fan, this is worth a shot, pun intended.<br /><br />Enjoy."
182,4,Not in stock,"The tea itself is very good. I tried to purchase this item as a gift for my father. Unfortunately, amazon's ""in stock"" in this case meant way out of stock. They finally bothered to tell me a month after the original order, and now the Customer service rep tells me that they have no plans to get it in stock for me. And yet, I notice the site still says ""in stock""!!!<br /><br />Buyer beware: Just because amazon says it's in stock and ready to ship does NOT mean it is now (nor ever will be) in stock. If it's a food item, like this one, you're much better off to make a special request at your local grocer."
183,4,Not an Italian Sauce,"I used to buy this sauce every time I saw it in the store, sometimes 5 or 6 cans at a time, because it wasn't so easy to find. I find the Hunts pasta sauces taste fresher than jarred sauces and are more flavorful too. But over a year ago, they changed the ingredients for the spicy style sauce. It used to be slightly peppery and spicy, but now it tastes like it might make a good base for chili or chili pasta or even a Mexican dish. Not bad, but definitely not an Italian flavored sauce."
184,4,Delicious coffee that is organic and fair-trade,"This coffee is very smooth and has a great flavor, medium roast, without being bitter.<br /><br />The pods do not fit in a Keurig machine so you will need to cut each one and empty it into a Keurig insert for regular coffee grounds such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, refillable filter for Keurig Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a>.  This seems to work fine for me, just be sure you don't over fill as the pod may contain a bit more grounds than needed for a Keurig."
185,4,Delicious healthy granola,"I was really excited to try this product as I am a HUGE fan of their bars. It was very good. It's always great to find a source for Omega 3 's. The amazing variety of grains used in this is a selling point to me, I like the variety and it's not over-sweet. I do like granola that's not all broken up into tiny little pieces, but has some chunks in it, which this does have.<br /><br />Kind granola is also gluten free and vegan friendly. If you are on a restricted diet this is perfect. I thought the cinnamon was just the right amount, not overpowering. To me, things that are 'healthy' for you aren't very useful unless they taste good too, this tastes good. Enjoy it on yogurt, or out of the bag, or with milk. I put it in little baggies and throw it in my backpack for a snack at school."
186,4,yummy healthy snack,Kashi does it again; tasty healthy snack to fill you up and tide you over!
187,4,Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water,"If you like coconut water, this is for you! I had bought this product at a local market to try, while having chemo. Turns out the more i drank, the more i wanted! It has potassium in it, and some chemo makes you potassium deficient. So, i felt better drinking this product,along with lots of water, to say hydrated."
188,4,Good for a flavored coconut water,"I grew up in Hawaii so yes, I know what real coconuts taste like. This has a light peach and mango flavor(made with real mango and peach puree) that is pretty nice. It is not overwhelming like the tangerine one. I still prefer plain coconut water."
189,4,Call it luck!,"It might have been luck or the fact that I ordered some other products as well, but I managed to get a box of these without ANY of them leaking.  No sticky mess, just a few dented, which can be expected.  Box was inside a bigger box with a few other items and some air bags.  Great creamer without the sticky mess!"
190,4,Kona coffee,The coffee did not arrive by the expected ship date and it was supposed to be a Christmas present for my<br />husband so I was disappointed.  I do not drink coffee but he says that it is good to excellent and very smooth.
191,4,My Favorite Kracker,I order these all the time.  They have a good taste and are a great snack.  They are a bit pricey however.
192,4,1 out of 2 dogs liked it!,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best.<br />A new idea for treats is always welcomed.  We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it."
193,4,Great product.,"I must begin by saying I LOVE coconut oil. Cooking, beauty, healthcare...I've used it in many different applications. The reason I took off a star is because when this shipped (in a warm month) it came liquified and upon solidifying became somewhat grainy. I tried a different brand that came the same way but solidified without any graininess. If you're not going to consume it straight out of the container this should not bother you at all."
194,4,Cappacino,"An excellent product. Too bad it's not readily available in the stores. Walmart used to carry it, but I'm told the Grove Square rep is not responsive. Seems foolish to me."
195,4,"Tastes great, good price and fast service",This tea has a good flavor--not too strong or too weak. It isn't as great as say a fresh looseleaf but is comparable to Twinnings' Eng Breakfast.
196,4,Amazing for the few who will enjoy it,"The smell you first get from opening this container is pungent and will make u go 'wtf'. Once spread on buttered toast, is a whole different story. Its deep nutty, fishy flavor is very umami. Don't use too much."
197,4,Great tea be aware of the packaging,"I have been drinking bigelow tea for five years and enjoy the flavor.  The 40 count packages include ten packages with four tea bags in each rather than one per package.  I drink two cups a day and the teas is still fresh on the second day.  When exposed to air the tea will lose its flavor.  So, if you only drink two or three cups a week look for packaging with one tea bag per package."
198,4,love this shampoo!,"I really like the quality of this new shampoo...lots of bubbles, no fadeing of my blonde toned highlights either.  Also, it does what it says, lots of lift and volume.  The only thing I would probably change is the scent.  The scent is not anything special, but the quality of this product is great.  I will definitely purchase here."
199,4,Somewhere Over the Horizon,"This drink is very refreshing. Everybody has different taste buds, so naturally some people will really like it while others will find it to be not as appetizing. I would recommend buying this product in bulk at a local grocery store or department store as you will be able to save more money that way. Two straws up for me for the product itself. I gave it four stars rather than 5 because of the price."
200,5,Truly citrus-y,"I haven't ordered from here because so many people have said something about the shipping on other True Lemon items. It's a shame, the price is great.<br />My family keeps all 3 flavors in the house. I use it in water of course. I also use the lime on chicken with honey sometimes, the lemon in salad dressings and shortbread and the orange in shortbread. My daughter loves having a packet of orange in hot water with honey when she's not feeling well. It's a great shelf stable way to be able add some extra flavor to a lot of cooking."
201,5,Taste of Home,"I'm currently (far) out of Pennsylvania for graduate school, and this just made my day. A little taste of home! Who knew PA was the snack and processed food capital of the world? Peanut chews are amazingly tasty, and slightly addictive. You can never eat one."
202,5,"My friends jokingly call this ""Miracle Tea""","I discovered this tea in a little cafe in Costa Del Sol, Spain. It was a particularly cloudy night and I was not properly dressed for the occasion (as the weather was deceptively hot during the day). As I began to feel worse and worse and watch the snot drip down my nose, my group went into a cafe and I asked for chamomile tea...but they didn't have it. Instead, they gave me the closest thing to it - tila tea.<br /><br />In just one sip of this tea (with only sugar added and nothing else), I felt all of the mucus clear out of me. Apparently linden flowers are particularly good at doing this and a few other remedies.<br /><br />For such a cheap price (shipping of course is a little high because it has to be exported from Spain, so buy two boxes to make yourself feel better [and to save money]), I highly recommend this product. Never had an issue with the vendor either."
203,5,Davidoff instant coffee,"Excellent choice for when you don't want a full pot or are in a hurry. Very smooth with no bitterness. Far superior to Folgers, Maxwell House and others."
204,5,"Good Earth, great tea!",One of the best teas on the market. Cannot purchase it locally so am glad that it is available through Amazon.
205,5,Good Product,"I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied. It works very well. I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be ""too good""."
206,5,MsJBird,"If you haven't had a Wickles you have got to try them.  My whole family goes crazy over Wickles, I ordered them through Amazon at a higher price than what I can get them for in Iuka, MS. but since I'm in Houston, TX and can't find them anywhere, I don't mind paying an extra .75 cents for a jar of Wickles.  Plus I'm a Prime Member so shipping is FREE!!  Love me some Wickles and love my Amazon!!"
207,5,Love this!,"Such a perfect companion to the Babycook! I freeze in this and once the food is frozen, I take them out and put in a labeled ziploc because the lid doesn't quite seal tight enough for my comfort but would definitely purchase again!"
208,5,"Good Coffee, Good Price","After looking for French Vanilla k-cups I stumbled on this pack, which originally I chose because they were some of the least expensive I could find per k-cup.  When I got them, my husband loved them & has since switched to these over his normal k-cups.  They do have a vanilla flavor, not too sweet or overpowering, so if you like a very strong vanilla flavor you could add flavored creamer or select a different brand.  I myself will not drink normal coffee, and even with flavored coffee tend to add quite a bit of creamer & sugar.  This coffee I was able to cut my sugar back & I don't need to add creamer/milk & I like it.  I would definitely buy it again."
209,5,One of my favorites!,"I have read many places that STASH has the highest amounts of antioxidants found in green tea. It is a little pricier than some other brands, but the taste is good, so it is worth it."
210,5,Great snack,"My son has been eating pouches for just about a year and loves the peter rabbit brand. Great for in the car, a quick snack or when camping. These are a great value compared to the other brands (Ella's, Plum, Happy tot, etc). We definitely stock up on these in our house."
211,5,Best jerky EVER!!!,"Golden Islands caught my interest when I found there little shop in a mall in ontario, ca. All there flavors scream elegance and class. Pure joy is what I have experienced from any of the flavors I've had from them and this one is no different. slightly spicy, with that lime tart taste, very refreshing compared to any other chilli/lime jerky you would have anywhere else."
212,5,My kitty LOVES it.,"The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now."
213,5,Incredible Hot Chocolate with Raspberry,"I ran into this product at a bed and breakfast.  Unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component, the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate.  You don't get just a hint of it that soon gets lost.  You taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip....very very enjoyable.  Highly recommend."
214,5,Best Tasting Sea Salt So Far!,"For some reason this sea salt taste different than any sea salt I have ever tasted.  In am not a sea salt conasuer but I knew this salt was ""the one"" after my first taste.  I don't know if sea salt taste differently from region to region or what but I highly recommend this specific brand for its taste. As a side note about sea salt, I have suffered migrains all of my life and after getting rid of table salt and switching to sea salt 40 years of migrains vanished.  I must have needed some type of mineral that is in natural sea salt, I am guessing. Table salt is stripped of all minerals and has additives for its preservation while shipping which is something our bodies don't need anyway!"
215,5,Nice color,"The pink color is very nice and bright. I made some candy hearts and they came beautifull. I also used it for cake pops but it have to be mixed with a little amount of paramount crystals to be liquid enough for coating the cake pops. It's liquids much better than Wilton's.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008DI8OY"">Paramount Crystals</a>"
216,5,Nutritional information,"These bars are one of my favorites.  They are the lowest in calories of all the Larabars, too.  The cherry pie bar contains just Dates, Almonds, and Unsweetened Cherries.  Total calories = 190.  Total fat = 9 gm.  No sodium.  Total carbs = 24g (4g fiber, 17g sugars)"
217,5,Great tea for pregnancy,I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
218,5,"A big hit with the ""kids""","I just ordered these after my dogs' favorite chews were discontinued by the manufacturer. They love these things! Both are about 40-45 pounds and pretty strong chewers, and these last them at least a few minutes (which is pretty good for them!)."
219,5,This gum tastes great,My family loves this gum because not only does it taste good but it's good for you.
220,5,Delicious!,"Light as air - not packed with sugar like some dried fruits.<br />Taste delicious!<br />Between my husband and I, they go fast!<br />If you like strawberries, you definitely need to try these."
221,5,Good balanced flavors; I prefer it without milk,"The cereal is not ""sugary sweet"" (meaning that the primary flavor isn't sugar). The raisins are soft and plentiful (I remember eating Raisin Bran as a kid, when the raisins were like little rocks). The slivered almonds add to the overall crunch, but their subtle flavor is somewhat lost to the taste of raisins and cinnamon. The bran flakes are crispy, but they rapidly wilt when milk is added. For that reason, I prefer to eat this cereal like ""trail mix""...there's no law that says you HAVE to put milk on cereal, but if that's the way you prefer it (and if you eat at a normal pace, as opposed to wolfing down your meals) you may wish to seek out a heartier flake. That said, for my personal tastes, I'm still giving the product five stars."
222,5,GREAT,This is a great treat for my dog/puppy for training! I am taking classes and petsmart right now and they require us to bring our own pet treats. This is such a great treat and my dog loves it. I've had it for a very long time so it last a good amount. I will be purchasing them as soon as I am about to run out! I recommend everyone getting this!!
223,5,Two paws up!,"My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied ""Yo momma is fat!"") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!"
224,5,Nuts about Bergin's nuts...,"I had never heard of Bergin nuts before ordering them, but decided to give them a try.  Ordered both pepitas and brazil nuts.  Both products arrived on time and well-packaged.  They are excellent, taste-wise.  The pepitas were roasted and seasoned perfectly.  The brazil nuts were fresh, sweet and whole.<br /><br />Highly recommend these products..."
225,5,My very picky cats love it,"I love this brand. I have two very picky cats and they love this! They are both healthy, energetic with glossy coats - very happy with the Goodlife cat food for indoor cats."
226,5,Excellent flavor!,"I love these things, for munching as well as adding to things like cornbread.  The ""roasted"" flavor is noticeable and excellent, and the veggies are sweet and crispy.<br /><br />Tasty."
227,5,Gimborn Liver Treats,The Gimborn Liver Treats are by far my dogs favorite treat.  The are a wonderful training reward.  Very good quality.  Just beware your dog will sniff them out from wherever they are hidden in your pockets.
228,5,Organix Adult Indoor Feline Dry Cat Food,I found this type of cat food to be excellent for my cat's health and weight.  She was a bit overweight and it helped bring it under control.  Although I did find that she didn't like it as much as her old dry cat food because it didn't have as much flavor.
229,5,"Awesome price, great quality!","This product is a great deal, especially when you ""subscribe"".  Coconut oil is the best for cooking, and I'm stoked that I can order it on amazon.com on a regular basis."
230,5,Great for ice coffee,"During the summer I like to add lots of ice to my coffee and make it cold. However adding lots of ice will tend to dilute the coffee and make it bland. This dark Roast coffee is strong and makes perfect ice coffee. The flavor is also excellent, one of my favorites."
231,5,Care Bears Toys,"My daughter loves these. We did get doubles, but that was fine. They come in a bag and not package as shown (as others have stated), but honestly it wasn't a huge concern as they were still brand new."
232,5,"I love these, price aside","I got these as gifts and absolutely love them. Yes, you can use ice cube trays to freeze baby food & other things but these are so much more convenient for me since they're = a jar of baby food, plus the reason I really love them is that I have continued to use them all the time after we were done with purees. I have 19 month old twins & made all their purees & continue to make a lot of their food and freeze things ahead for easy defrost & prep at the end of my work day when we get home & they're starving.  I'm not sure why another person was trying to scoop the portions out with a spoon (?) but all you have to do is run hot water over the back side for about 30 sec and everything pops out no problem. I have the same issue w/ ice cube trays so I don't really understand the issue others have reported.<br />So, in addition to purees, I have frozen things like the following in these to = 1/2 or full portion sizes for my kids (depending on how old they were, obviously I need to defrost more of them as they get older): risottos, ground beef/turkey, small meatballs & sauce, mac & cheese, small portions of elbow macaroni (when they were younger & couldn't eat as much), and anything else really that can be smooshed into the container. These are things that would not work in an ice cube tray & freezing in a million containers or one big one is not practical, at least for me.<br /><br />It's too bad they're not a little more affordable but I do think they're great."
233,5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product and fast shipping. This is the best tasting tuna on the market today. After eating this, I don't know how anyone could eat the ""packed in water"" canned tuna generally available on the market today."
234,5,Healthy choice,"This is a great tasting, good for you, snack that you can take with you anywhere."
235,5,My dogs loved these treats!,"I highly recommend these dog treats!! Both of my dogs loved these treats.  They would do just about anything to have these treats.  They really do not smell good to me, but luckly I don't have to eat them!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW"">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>"
236,5,Addictive,"My toddler loves these and she has since she first tried them. She would eat an entire can in one sitting if I would let her. They are also great for teething, which is not something I anticipated. They are not the healthiest snack out there but they work great at pacifying an angry toddler stuck in her car seat."
237,5,Ginger Heaven,"WOW!!!  I've had crystallized ginger before, but I have never had anything this wonderful!!  It is so fresh and tender, it is almost juicy...INCREDIBLE.  I've shared it with some friends who also LOVE IT!!  By the way...I've always been happy with ANY product that I have purchased on AMAZON!  THANKS!!!!!"
238,5,High Quality Food,My two cats love this food!  I normally buy the chicken and the beef/chicken formulas and have been using it ~ 2 yrs now.  High quality ingredients with no corn or preservatives are a priority for me since my cats previously had issues with allergies and dander.  My cats no longer have dry skin and now only have some seasonal allergies instead of year round problems.<br /><br />The negative is that Wellness food is expensive.  I'm always on the lookout for coupons and I buy larger quantities in wet and dry food to save.  I only give my cats wet food once a day and use a feeder with a timer to ration out dry food for the rest of the day.
239,5,Chocolate,Excellent.  It arrived on time.  I bought several boxes and gave some away as gifts.  Everyone enjoyed them without any complaints.  It is a lot easier to buy this way instead of trying to bring them back from Hawaii.
240,5,What I eat for breakfast everyday,I have a gluten intolerance and regular oats give me terrible heartburn and indigestion. The gluten free oats do not. They taste great and I eat them every morning. Best to buy 2 cases to avoid shipping costs.
241,5,Ellas,My baby loves this product. I even tried it and it was very yummy. I cant wait to get more for him.
242,5,Canidae Dry Dog Food,"This is a great product. It is very healthy for all of our dogs, and it is the first food that they all love to eat. It helped my older dog lose weight and my 10 year old lab gain the weight he needed to be healthy."
243,5,The best beans you'll ever have in under 10 minutes,These beans are AWESOME!!!!<br />If you can boil water you can have beans that are better than almost any Mexican restaurant and that are actually healthy for you. My 6 yr. old and 18 month old can eat a whole bag themselves with a couple of tortillas.
244,5,Momo approved!,"I don't own a dog, but I do have friends who do. They own a small, fluffy white dog of a nonspecific variety named Momo. He was a stray, so they don't know how old he is, but he's clearly getting up there in years. I know they want to take good car of him, so when the chance came up to snag them a quality dog food, I did so. They fed him some of the food the other day.<br /><br />According to my friends, Momo initially turned up his nose at the food, and walked away. About twenty minutes later, he came back and started chowing down. He ate, according to them, far more than he usually does. They also commented that they personally liked the fact that it ""looked like"" real food.<br /><br />So there you go. Momo the dog likes the food, and his owners are pleased by it, too."
245,5,Loved these Tartlets,What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.
246,5,Oh man!  Good stuff!,I developed my packaged unsweetened green tea habit while on vacation in Maui.  I'd pound down one in the morning and would just feel great.  Jumped on this pack the second I saw it on sale.  The bottle and cap are of high quality.
247,5,Great Nuts!,This was shipped quickly from the vendor and these pistachios are delicious.  Fresh and no salt - just like I like nuts.
248,5,Delicious alternative tea,"Runa is a brand new tea that I drink everyday. I love the balanced, energizing feel I get from it. Apparently guayusa has been drunk for thousands of years in the rain forests of Ecuador and is now making its way to market in the US for the first time. Runa also seems to have a great back story of environmental conservation and social empowerment of indigenous groups. In fact I just heard a story covered on NPR's Marketplace about the partnership between Runa, the socialist Ecuadorian government and the farmers.<br /><br />The Amazon Spice has a nice cinnamon undertone with high notes from the lemongrass, the Ginger Citrus is also really good and slightly spicier from the ginger with clean citrus zest flavor, the traditional is good to see what guayusa by itself tastes like- smooth and naturally, subtly sweet with no tannin. I've never had the spearmint but I bet its good for people who like mint tea."
249,5,Perfect food for my spoiled pets,"I started looking into pet foods when I read about people having pets with crystals blocking their urine. Although I'm far from an expert, I started reading that people believed the crystals were formed based on what their pets were eating. This sent me on a search for a different type of pet food, one that was natural and not full of fillers that my cats don't need. Although this brand seems expensive, it lasts just as long as the cheap brands because it's full of protein and my cats eat way less. So, in the long run, my cats are eating food that is much better for them and it costs about the same as running through cheaper brands. My cats love the taste of this, too."
