0,B001LXYA5Q,1,1308268800,"I was quite excited to try this product, so I bought 4 packs. We opened one, and I tested a half-tablet. No result. My wife tried the other half. Ditto. The next day, we tried a full tablet, letting it completely dissolve over the entire tongue. I found the tablets pretty tasty themselves, while my wife found them too chalky to enjoy. Anyway, again there was no effect with lemons, chili sauce, etc. Our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods.<br /><br />Happily for me, the company is going to refund me for the other three packages. But I would have preferred that they'd worked. I was looking forward to bringing them out at an upcoming party."
1,B001LXYA5Q,1,1298851200,I guess everyone's taste buds are different.  This product didn't work for me.  Every food item tasted as it should :-(
2,B001LXYA5Q,1,1256947200,Dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on ANY of the foods that I tried.
3,B001LXYA5Q,2,1284768000,"After taking a tab, I was able to eat a hot pepper, but it didn't really taste sweet or good at all, just not very hot.  Then I tried some cayenne pepper, which remained hot with no alteration in taste.This is a nice idea, but didn't work for me."
4,B001LXYA5Q,1,1326844800,"I bought my mberry pack from mberry.us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth. I followed the directions to the letter, allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue. I then tried balsalmic vinegar - nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little. So I tried hot sauce - nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot. Then I tried regular vinegar - nothing happened again. I even tried taking a second tablet, but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue. HUGE waste of money. Super disappointing. DOES NOT WORK!"
5,B001LXYA5Q,1,1295222400,"Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the ""mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets"" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry ""Believers of Miracles""... this is one that won't make ""The Tonight Show""!"
6,B001LXYA5Q,1,1329696000,"I was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee's birthday around these tablets.<br />Placed an order well in advance, namely 3 weeks in advance.<br /><br />After two weeks of waiting, I received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem. The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.<br /><br />Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.<br /><br />This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled)<br />they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem."
7,B001LXYA5Q,2,1327708800,"I'm jealous of whoever thought of this, but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. It turns out, if you eat half a fruit roll-up, then eat asparagus, the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect.  There. That's all you need to know.  DON'T buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time you're at Wal-Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers."
8,B001LXYA5Q,1,1232150400,"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE."
9,B001LXYA5Q,1,1317772800,"Well I bought these to have a ""Food Tripping Party"" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, ""Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?"" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. I'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say. To all the people who threw parties and raved and raved about how everyone loved them, my guess is that they didn't want you to feel bad."
10,B001LXYA5Q,1,1234483200,It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.
11,B001LXYA5Q,4,1234656000,"This product definitely works.<br />I was not aware that i was supposed to break the tablet in half. After eating a whole tablet, I ate a lemon. It was WAY WAY too sweet!<br />I waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food.<br />I tried a 1/2 tablet the next day. I added some lemon to a glass of water. To me, it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda. It didn't taste like regular sugar. Which i guess is good. The sweet taste was just different.<br />I also ate cottage cheese, it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it.<br />The product works immediately by the way. No waiting for this to work.<br /><br />I think this product will last me a while.<br />The day after this review I took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1/2 tablet.I made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me. Not overly sweet, tasted like a lemon drop ;p<br />Your mileage may vary with this product.<br /><br />I've heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one.<br />I just ordered a pack from another company. I will report back.<br /><br />I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I'm trying to lose some weight. I'm hoping these tablets will help me with that :)"
12,B001LXYA5Q,3,1239494400,"After reading reviews and testing these out with friends, I can say this: Everyone's tastes (and tastebuds) are different. What is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another. So be ye warned, results for these may vary.<br /><br />I found that the tablets didn't make things ""sweet"" as much it cut down on the sourness, almost like a numbing effect.  Ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it? The sour kick is still there, just canceled out. I'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest.<br /><br />Tried out a few beer types, with mixed results: Beers that are fruity/citrus ended up gross, as it would taste like I mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer. Dark beers like an Irish Red were my favorite.<br /><br />I really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things. Certain foods will take you for surprise (ranch dressing, for example, was notably different and very good)."
13,B001LXYA5Q,5,1235606400,"Wow, I DID NOT EXPECT such a quick, shocking result from this product, but it definitely delivers!!! My brother told me about these tablets and the ""flavor tripping"" parties. I had never heard of them before, but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange, a sort of ""Ripley's Believe it or not"" kind of novelty.<br />Anyway, the tablets WORK immediately. I just took one, had a lemon, and voila': it's SWEET! I also tried a sip of Chianti wine.. SWEET.... I poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water... SWEET... I haven't tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will!<br />The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don't need to sweeten my tea! I'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.<br />Hmmm... perhaps I can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft-drink!! The possibilities are endless!"
14,B001LXYA5Q,4,1239753600,"I do reccomend this product, as it is effective and very fun to try. Here are the setbacks: It only lasts around 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I bought these in lieu of the actual berries ($90 vs. $10) so they weren't as potent as I had read about/expected. Nonetheless, they do work! Lemons and limes were delicious!<br />Oh, be sure to move the tablet over the ENTIRE surface of your tounge in order to cover ALL of your taste buds."
15,B001LXYA5Q,4,1276905600,"Basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things, they will instead taste sweet. Lemons taste like a strong lemonade. Some of you might be thinking, well that's fun and all but how would my lover taste? well, kind of sweet(men and women). Give it a try you'll see. My only complaint is that they made them look so much like a drug that I had to convince some of my more prudish friends that it was just ground fruit."
16,B001LXYA5Q,5,1322784000,"I saw an article on Yahoo and figured I would give it a try. This stuff was unbelievable. I ate healthy foods for the first try. Some carrots, spinach, a red pepper and an orange. It was probably the best meal I had ever tasted. It was like I was eating a fruit picked from Eden. On the downside I could see this becoming an addiction!"
17,B001LXYA5Q,5,1321833600,"I got these for me and my boyfriend to try but he refused to try it with me... at first. I tried to explain to him that it's just fruit put in a pill form but he was convinced it was some type of trick I was trying to pull on him. Anyways so I went to the store and picked up some lemons, limes, tomatoes, kiwi, oatmeal stout beer (which I absolutely hate stout beer), sour candy and some red hots. I let the pill dissolve on my tongue and started out trying a lemon. One thing I recommend which I didn't do was to try out all the food first to get something to compare it to. I sat in front of my boyfriend and ate a whole lemon without even flinching. Then I told him to try it and he could barely lick it without making a face. Then I tried some stout beer... it tasted like cold coffee with a hint of kahluah. I eventually got him to take one of the pills. We had sooo much fun tasting foods!! it was amazing how much it worked!!!! I already recommended it to all my friends and now I recommend it to you. It can be a really cool party trick by betting someone you can eat a whole lemon without making a face."
18,B001LXYA5Q,5,1236816000,"After dissolving one tab on my tongue, I ate 1/4 of a large lime, and it tasted mostly sweet with just a hint of tartness!  I would have eaten the whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach.  I didn't notice any difference when I ate parsley, though--the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me.  Miracle Berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff, but not at all as far as I could tell with bitter stuff.<br /><br />Still, well worth the price to experience this amazing transformation in taste.<br /><br />Edit:  I had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse-type store.  I planned on eating them all at one sitting, but after one or two I couldn't eat them--they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet.  I remembered that I had some of these tablets left, so I rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved, and thereafter the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet, so I was able to finish them all."
19,B001LXYA5Q,4,1324339200,"The mberry tabs work by altering your taste receptors and make sour tasting foods more sweet. I'm a high school science teacher, and I used these both in my classes and for my science club. The students love trying out different sour food items to taste the results. I've used this brand several times, and it seems to be pretty consistent in it's effectiveness and quality. The best way I can describe the effect of these tabs is it makes a lemon taste like a lemon ""shake-up"" from a fair/carnival. It does not create a super ""candy-like"" sweetness (which I think would be really weird anyway), there is still a hint of sour behind the sweet taste. Also, they do not last anywhere near an hour, more like 15-20 min., so just be warned, and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth. In my experience, there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective, maybe between 5-15% in a group (1-3 people per 20). The tabs are somewhat expensive, but as a pretty unique experience, I definitely recommend trying it at least once!"
20,B001LXYA5Q,5,1321142400,"I just did a test run for a work party and I sampled raspberries, strawberries, lemons, limes, Tabasco sauce, goats cheese, beer, orange juice, and yogurt. First off, the lemon was the best tasting example of fruit I have ever had in my life. I wanted to eat the whole thing. The rest of the fruits tasted delicious. The unsweetened yogurt was good, the orange juice amazing, and the beer much sweeter. The goats cheese didnt taste that yummy to me and the tabasco sauce didnt have a noticeable change in flavor. Over all, a very fun and effective flavor changing experience!"
21,B001LXYA5Q,4,1317772800,"It does change the way you taste but not to such a great effect that you are expecting. It's more of a pleasant surprise and not a OMG! surprise. It makes sour and most fruits sweeter. It makes beer taste like some sort of sugary juice (and I don't like beer). I would like to try cream cheese and wine which are supposed to be yummy. I recommend this product and I only need a half a tablet to last about 45 min to an hour. I wouldn't dare try spicy foods as they suggest on the package but they suggest pineapple, cheese, peppers, and limes. Lemon in water tasted like lemonade with tons of sugar. I would experiement and see how it works out for you. It doesn't work on all foods though like potatoes or meats, as it mostly alters your sour or tart taste buds."
22,B001LXYA5Q,5,1307664000,My daughter had  me buy these for her 18th birthday party.  What a success!  The tablets arrived ahead of schedule so we could concentrate on other items.  The kids had a fun time trying out sour foods that became sweet after letting the tablets melt in their mouth. Everyone had a great time and really enjoyed them.  We're recommending them to everyone!
23,B001LXYA5Q,5,1234396800,"GREAT for parties.  This stuff actually works.  I was eating War-Heads, which I normally hate, like they were gummy bears.  Eating a lemon tasted like drinking lemonade.  You've got to try this stuff."
24,B001LXYA5Q,5,1302825600,"I purchased these tabs for my daughters ""flavor tripping"" party. I have never tried them out before so I invited a couple of friends over to experience this with me. I set up a spread our items, gave everyone a mberry, and got to tasting. The first item that we tried was a lemon and we were literally blown away because they were so sweet and tasty. Next came the dill pickle and it tasted like a sweet pickle. We even tried ketchup and mustard and couldn't stop dipping out fingers in it because the flavors were unbelievable. We also had a bottle of cheap dry wine and it was delicious. The strawberries were so delicious that we ate the entire bowl. Fruit rollups were great too. This is something that I know my daughter will enjoy at her party and I will be trying these time and time again."
25,B001LXYA5Q,4,1298678400,"After reading an article online a while back about flavor tripping, I went looking for miracle berries and was surprised to find these handy tablets on Amazon. I was worried they wouldn't pack the punch the actual berries were reputed to, but they turned out to be a great purchase.<br /><br />It's true that how effective they are varies by person, and by the foods you try them with, but overall these were a big hit at numerous gatherings of friends and family. I've found that the biggest hits tend to be vinegar, and tart citrus like lemons, limes, or grapefruit juice. For me all go from being sour to very sweet (yes, to the point where if I didn't know better I'd be gulping the vinegar down). Dark beers are interesting, with the changed flavor still usually somewhat enjoyable. Foods or drinks that are already very sweet become cloying and unpleasant. It's still worth trying just to see the effect, but keep that in mind when choosing things to try with the tablets in advance.<br /><br />I've ordered these 4 times, and hope to do so again (at the time of this writing, they are not available). If they remain out of stock for too long, I'll have to try some of the alternatives. I'm reluctant to do so though, knowing how effective these are."
26,B001LXYA5Q,5,1292198400,"My friend and I had a flavor tripping party for two.  We each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons, limes and other sour items.  The effect was immediate and amazing.  We were laughing hysterically throughout the whole ordeal.  We also tried shots of vinegar, mustard by the spoonful (really yummy) and several other types of fruit.  We had a blast finding new things to try.  I think next we're going to have a big group over to play around.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you can split the tablets in half to lessen the effect.  Remember - if you're going to have a flavor tripping party of your own, pack some antacid.  After all we ate, we really needed it.<br /><br />Updates 12/20 - I gave mberry pills to friends for the holidays.  The pills didn't work for all of them.  Judging by some of the reviews the pills either don't work for everyone or not every pill is the same potency.  I contacted the seller who put me in touch with the manufacturer and they are sending me out a replacement batch to give the people who had a bad experience.  Excellent customer service all around.  I still wholeheartedly recommend giving the tablets a try.  If it works for you, it is really amazing."
27,B001LXYA5Q,5,1240012800,"A friend referred me to these and told me that they were ""freaking awesome."" I decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well.  I found that the taste of them, while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid, but nothing I couldn't tolerate.<br /><br />After it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it.  We cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did.  The lemons tasted like a 'lemon drop' candy, and the limes were very refreshing.  We then expanded our horizons and started trying other things to see what it was like. We found some other foods to be excellent, and others not so much.  All in all it's very fun.<br /><br />They are, however, quite expensive. The effects on me lasted roughly 1-1.5 hours.  So as a novelty, hurray for these."
28,B001LXYA5Q,4,1258502400,"This is a neat product, and it does what it says it does.  However, if you decide to have a party where you invite guests to partake of handfuls of raw cranberries, lemons juice, tabasco sauce, beer, mustard, and a variety of other items which are sour, the miracle berry can do nothing at all to augment the considerable effect this will have on their bowels."
29,B001LXYA5Q,5,1347148800,"I ordered these after hearing about them from some friends. I was very skeptical if it would even really work noticeably and was even more skeptical about the ""pill form"". But WOW! They really do work! It makes anything bitter or sour taste instantly sweet. I tried a few things and could definitely tell they were sweeter. But the most noticeable was the lemon. I really didn't even want to try it at first but i was told i had to. It tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever. Seriously, it was like candy all of the sudden. I almost couldn't believe it. When a few friends were over i gave them a pill each and we all of the sudden lemons were the best thing ever lol!"
30,B001LXYA5Q,5,1345161600,"I purchased this for my mother who is currently undergoing some powerful chemotherapy. During her first chemo, she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of pulling teeth to get her to eat something. She called me and asked me to order her this because an oncology nurse that she is friends with suggested it. During her second chemo she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during chemo a small miracle. We were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately!"
31,B001LXYA5Q,4,1329696000,Effects with some foods are more remarkable than others. I found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable.
32,B001LXYA5Q,5,1327449600,I got these tablets to try them out to see if they really worked and to my suprise they do and they made lemons taste amazing. Most of the other items on the list did not taste much better to me but I am still trying some out.
33,B001LXYA5Q,4,1327363200,"After reading most of the reviews, I was expecting the tablet to taste gross.  It does not.  It's not yummy, but it does have a slight (tart?) flavor to it.<br /><br />My first taste was of a strawberry.  It was way too sweet for me.  Almost tasted like I had put tons of sugar on the strawberry, or even sugar substitute.  Next I tried a blackberry, blueberry, pomegranate seed....they were sweeter, but I wasn't blown away by how ""good"" they tasted, just surprised at how my taste buds have changed.  Next up, a lemon!  Everyone has been right about the lemon, it tastes like lemonade!  I ate half of a lemon before I decided it was too sweet for me.  I put pomegranate flavored Greek yogurt over the fruit I just mentioned, and had a bite.  TOO SWEET for me!  Next up, some fermented spicy daikon (ever hear of ""Dave's Gourmet Korean food""?  Everything is fermented in vinegar and it is DELICIOUS!).  The vinegar taste was gone, but the spiciness remained.  Interesting.  I actually like the regular flavor, unaltered, so I won't be having that again.  Oh, I also tried chocolate flavored coconut water--yuck!  There was a chocolate CHALKY taste to it.  It has now been 30 minutes and I just tried the other half of the lemon.  It still tastes sweet to me.  And then I had a sip of veggie broth (from ""Dave's Korean"") which is the only thing that has changed in a way that was pleasing to my taste buds.<br /><br />I'm giving the mberry four stars because it DOES do what it claims, it's just not my preferred way of tasting things."
34,B001LXYA5Q,5,1325808000,Make sure you salivate a lot and don't swallow for best results. They'll typically last a few hours. They're a big hit for guests. You can even get by with half after you've had one or two. Doesn't work too well on liquors but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect.
35,B001LXYA5Q,5,1296518400,"Chewed a few of these and ate cheese, hot sauce and a bunch of citrus. Pretty neat stuff. If it was less expensive I could see this benefiting those who'd like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits."
36,B001LXYA5Q,4,1290816000,"It works, that's what matters. People have to nit-pick every little thing. Maybe it doesn't last forever, but it's not meant to.<br /><br />My experience - melted it on my tongue and ate some foods I couldn't normally eat. This means it worked, and real good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: strawberries!!! Willing to buy these again just for eating strawberries. Limes are tasty too."
37,B001LXYA5Q,5,1255305600,"I took these over to a friends house and tried them with amazing results. After sucking on the pill and letting it dissolve for a few minutes, it really did make everything sour, taste sweet. We tried lemons, limes, even sour candy. The weird thing is, they didn't affect the taste of sweet things, like oranges. These are great for a dinner party."
38,B001LXYA5Q,4,1244073600,"Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing, that it made everything super sweet. So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of ""oh my god, it's amazing"" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal."
39,B001LXYA5Q,4,1239753600,"The tablets do work but from I read in the description that half a tablet would work- it does, but you have to make sure your whole tongue and mouth had decent contact with the tablet piece.  The tablet dissolves quite fast in your mouth so 1/2 tablet may be too little.<br /><br />I tried again using 1 tablet and had good results- then tried with 2 and had slightly better results.  The effect was pretty good.  Lemons are still a bit sour to eat raw but its not that bad.  Grapefruit is particularly awesome with this tablet.  Limes were in between- still a little sour but tasted quite nice.  Overall I could still not eat too much lemon or lime and the acid content of both got me worried about stomaching too much."
40,B001LXYA5Q,5,1349827200,"this is a great product. i gave a few tablets away to family and friends and they all loved it. it made anything with citric acid sweet,and even made some fruits sweeter. its a real experience for the palet."
41,B001LXYA5Q,5,1347667200,"This tablets were really fun to try out. My parents, my siblings, and my friends all loved them and were so confused on how well they worked. Do not drink store bought orange juice though! It was sickly sweet because of the sugar added and the acid in it! My favorite was fresh pineapple and sucking on limes. (Limes were sweeter for me than the lemons)"
42,B001LXYA5Q,5,1341446400,"This product makes me want to buy a Miracle Fruit tree so I can have these awesome berries all the time.<br /><br />The biggest changes my husband and I noticed were in eating fruits & other berries. Store-bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant/bush/tree at the height of ripeness. It was like being a kid again and biting into my first :)<br /><br />I didn't notice any change at all with anything bitter. Beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same. Spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross. Savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness, but nothing THAT noticeable. Sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable.<br /><br />Definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue, and don't chew -- leave it on your tongue until it dissolves.<br /><br />If you're a fan of sweet, succulent fruit, but can't get fresh produce from farmer's markets, do yourself a favor and try these. It's worth the price for the fun, at the very least :)"
43,B001LXYA5Q,5,1337990400,"First things first, these actually work. I tried tons of different foods and they all tasted a lot better. If you haven't tried these already, it's a must. It is definitely a great experience"
44,B001LXYA5Q,5,1335744000,"Heard about these and simply had to check them out. Ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of ""flavor tripping."" That is exactly what it was, the tablets themself have an odd taste (not the best) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything I've had before. Lemons, kiwi, strawberries, cheese, mustard, cranberry juice, OJ, and a lot more. IT all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time. Everything was sweet and tasted (with few exclusions) much better. I ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite.<br /><br />These really are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who likes food."
45,B001LXYA5Q,5,1335225600,"Had fun with my family with the mberries, they absolutely worked for all 5 of us and it was a blast! Definitely worth a try!"
46,B001LXYA5Q,5,1334966400,It really did help my father is a cancer patient and. Didnt want to eat because the taste was no good.well the miracle berry gave him a good taste again
47,B001LXYA5Q,4,1330473600,Very interesting. The tablet itself doesnt taste that great but it melts pretty fast. The best stuff we found to try it with was apple and any citrus. It really sweetens the fruit. Its kinda crazy. It was fun.
48,B001LXYA5Q,5,1326326400,"I just bought the mberry with slight concerns that it will not work. All those concerns went away when I tried it. It was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue. I didn't notice anything. First thing i tried was a grape. I mean this was the most delicious grape I had ever tasted. I started try all the fruits and sodas i could. Amazing. People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade. I wouldn't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue. Not your stomach. When you buy these you run the risk that it won't work, but it probably will. Very pleased."
49,B001LXYA5Q,4,1323302400,"fun to try.  really, they're just an amazing way to eat lemons.  you can basically squeese lemons in water and it tastes delicious.<br /><br />I can't tell the difference between brands.  seem pretty much the same to me...<br /><br />they make a fun gift.  don't buy them for a mind bending experience, they're not drugs; they're a sort of food sweetener."
50,B001LXYA5Q,5,1320364800,The effect was just as described and worked for about 20-30 minutes. I'd recommend trying it if you're interested. You won't be disappointed.
51,B001LXYA5Q,5,1308700800,Fun! Changes taste of so many things! Try it! We almost drank a whole bottle of lemon juice after using this fruit that's how well it works!
52,B001LXYA5Q,5,1294704000,"I really enjoyed this, tried it with my family and my dad was so skeptical at first but when he took a bit into the lemon he was flabbergasted! The look on his face was priceless. Best for groups of friends unless you experiment alone but the more the merrier! Wish it came with more berries per the price which is a bit steep for tablets and not the real berries which are hard to come by. People said it lasts only a couple minutes but for me it was a decent 15 minutes or more. Obviously the lemons with juice and other fruits will make it end quicker since there are liquids washing it out. Just have everything prepared and on the table before you take it!"
53,B001LXYA5Q,4,1288828800,"I was researching the miracle berry protein miraculin for a research proposal, so I decided to give these tablets a try. The effect was immediate, and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers. Everyone was completely in love with the lemons, and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well. For some the effect was actually too sweet, and they gave up after a few foods. Other foods/beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries (lost their tartness), red wine vinegar (sweet on the tongue, but not so great in the throat) and Corona (loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it). It certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid, but it's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining."
54,B001LXYA5Q,4,1288656000,It works and lasts for a few minutes to make sours sweet.  Its trippy.
55,B001LXYA5Q,5,1285372800,"For a real tast treat, you have to try these. Sour foods taste sugary sweet. Apples, strawberries and oranges will taste like the most delicious fruit you've ever had. This makes for a fun party activity where guests will marvel over the ""wonderful vinegar"" and ""candy-like limes""."
56,B001LXYA5Q,2,1277078400,"Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.<br /><br />So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down."
57,B001LXYA5Q,3,1263254400,"These tablets did work, but were not nearly as effective as I had expected.  I set up an entire spread of foods, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, liquids etc to try and when my friends and I allowed the tablets to dissolve, they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time (maybe 5-10 min?)"
58,B001LXYA5Q,4,1262736000,"We found these tablets to be pretty fun! I suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth, not cutting it in half as others suggested. And definitely be sure to move the tablet around your ENTIRE tongue...I missed the back of my tongue when dissolving the tablet so whenever I'd swallow I'd get a hint of the real flavor.<br /><br />However, it was definitely neat to see how the tablet changes your taste!! We tried lemons, limes, grapefruit, buffalo wing flavored potato chips, sour patch kids, warhead sour spray, dill pickles, oranges, whiskey, and wine. I found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely AMAZING. The dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles, I had to double check the jar to make sure they weren't! Pinot grigio was particularly delicious, as the tablet cut through the sour-ness turning it super sweet!!<br /><br />Oranges were okay, just tasted a little sweeter than normal. The lemons were still a bit sour but I found myself eating 4 slices of them, which I don't think I could have done without the tablets! I swear, the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />We found that the more sour a food, the more drastic an effect. I definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods! I'd say some grapefruit, lemons, and dill pickles are a must to try with these.<br /><br />They're great to try with friends, as the novelty wears off after one or two tries. As long as there are new people around though, it's fun to see other reactions to the tablets. Definitely recommend!!"
59,B001LXYA5Q,5,1254355200,"I took one of these tablets, and the results were instantaneous. I drank some pure lemon juice, and it tasted like  very sweet lemonade. My Sister then tried it and spat it out immediately. I then tried a lime, which was delicious, and some cheese. I do not usually like cheese, but i after eating a little bit i was amazed at how wonderful it tasted with the tablets. I highly recommend this product, beacuse it will amaze you the moment you start tasting."
60,B001LXYA5Q,5,1232323200,"At first i did not think they would work, but i bought them after reading the scientific view of them and then decided to buy them just to see. After i got them i had to try something sour just to see, so i took a half tablet and put some lemon juice on my tung. Amazingly they worked!!! This is an awesome product for anyone who likes wired things or just has a liking of chemistry. :)"
61,B001LXYA5Q,1,1282262400,These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill/tablets. In my opinion.
62,B001LXYA5Q,4,1233532800,I tried two lemons after dissolving two tablets in my mouth.  It tasted just like lemonade.  One thing.  The package recommends 1 tablet.  That didn't work for me.  If you are a tad overweight two is better.
63,B001LXYA5Q,5,1322611200,"I seen this product on Dr. Oz and I just had to try this out to see if it works. Yes, it works and I can eat and drink lemon juice three times a day.<br />It is a miracle pill. :)"
64,B001LXYA5Q,4,1349222400,"I used the tablets and it made lime and lemon sweeter. It wasn't as sweet as all the other reviews claimed. The lemon tasted like a sort of ripe orange. I let my grandma try it, but she said it didn't work for her."
65,B001LXYA5Q,4,1343606400,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful."
66,B001LXYA5Q,3,1335916800,"They do make sour stuff sweet for a bit, but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor... great novelty item."
67,B001LXYA5Q,5,1329004800,"I've had this a few times before and it is amazing. Last time I had it a half pill was one dose so I thought this was a bit cheaper than it turned out to be but it's still great and well worth it at $2 per dose. I like that it also came with some recommended foods to try. Lemons and limes are by far the best, beer is pretty cool too."
68,B001LXYA5Q,5,1328659200,The mberry tablets worked great.  We tried a lot of the suggested pairings and most of them had some sort of fun taste after eating the tablets.
69,B001LXYA5Q,5,1326758400,"I was curious and decided to buy this product because of it (and despite the price).  It worked and is SERIOUSLY cool.  I followed the directions by putting a whole tablet on my tongue and letting it completely dissolved.  Sliced up a lemon and very warily put it in my mouth just to find that it tasted like a sweet lemonade.  There was only a slight tinge of sour.  I would have happily KEPT eating lemons, as they were delicious, the the acid on my lips told me to stop.  I plan on buying MUCH more of this product in the future.  It works and is fantastic!"
70,B001LXYA5Q,4,1304380800,"It was crazy, it made things taste super sweet, some things not at all though. However, this deliverer was extremely reliable and i receiver my package a day EARLY. A first for me with Amazon!"
71,B001LXYA5Q,5,1300665600,"My friend brought this over for a party, and we tried the limes, lemons, oranges and bananas! The initial taste of the tablet is pretty nasty, but just stick with it until it's dissolved completely on your tongue, coating it. After that, sour fruit like lemons and limes taste like the BEST sour candy you have ever tasted in your life and you will DEVOUR them :D"
72,B001LXYA5Q,4,1282780800,"It does work, but only for a short time.  You need to dissolve it on your tongue and then let the fun begin!"
73,B001LXYA5Q,4,1277078400,"This stuff works, but be warned the effect doesn't last very long for some people but it is still amazing. My friend and I tried eating a lemon slice and it was AMAZING... until the effect started to wear off slightly in the middle of it."
74,B001LXYA5Q,5,1274313600,"A very interesting and fun way to spend an evening. The tablet itself has a somewhat tart flavor, we sampled everything from cottage cheese to beers to fruits to salt and vinegar chips to warheads. Some differences were astounding, some not so much, great little adventure for your mouth."
75,B001LXYA5Q,5,1271116800,"Just a tad expensive, but neater than heck!!  It really does what it says!  Awesome!!"
76,B001LXYA5Q,5,1267920000,"They weren't mind-blowing, but they were definitely fun.  So far I've tried mine with a beer and a few snack foods.  Everything did taste noticeably sweet, especially the beer.  It ended up tasting like a cream soda.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to some more experimenting :)"
77,B001LXYA5Q,4,1265587200,"These tablets are quite odd, but they do work. They have a sort of chalky taste as you let them melt on your tongue, but if you get past that the effect is amazing. We ate whole lemons and limes. Oranges tasted like candy. It lasts for quite awhile too. They are definately worth a try."
78,B001LXYA5Q,4,1263859200,"This mberry product really worked for my friends and I. Unfortunately, it only worked for about 15 to 20 minutes at most. It still made for a really fun experience!<br />The food items that were the most awesome included cream cheese (tasted like cheesecake), grapefruit (tasted sweet without added sugar), lemons (tasted like they had grown from a ""lemonade tree""), and various assortments of beer (just a different taste all together).<br />Definitely worth the $15 bucks if you are a foodie and want to experience this food trend."
79,B001LXYA5Q,4,1261440000,"Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?  Maybe a good business venture."
80,B001LXYA5Q,5,1260576000,"This is my first time with the miracle berries in general. We got a bunch of friends over and everyone brought something. Oranges taste like the orange slice candies. And lemons taste like lemon drops. My favorite is the Christmas Beers that are available this time of year, they were almost like apple cider. Everyone had fun. Everything arrived fast, great seller. 5 STARS!!!"
81,B001LXYA5Q,4,1249948800,"These tablets definitely made things sweeter -- like lemons, limes, and grapefruit.  But it wasn't to the point of sheer amazement.  They also had an interesting effect on cheeses and vinegar, but still did virtually nothing for beer and wine. The tablets are a bit pricey but they do work.  If you've got extra money, sure, give them a try, but if you're looking for some amazing way to get your kids to eat broccoli or something along those lines then this is not the answer. Fun experiment, but not life-changing. :)"
82,B001LXYA5Q,2,1327795200,"I've tried this with multiple foods, at different times, and with anywhere between one and three tablets, all held on different areas of the tongue. While I could swear there were minor changes at low quantities, this didn't change no matter how many were tried. I'm sure that the Miracle Berries are authentic, but my friend and I didn't experience anything as incredible as people say, or even anything noteworthy. I would go for the actual fruit next time."
83,B001LXYA5Q,5,1317600000,"It works. i took one, 2 minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth. Last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat. if your into trying new things give these a try. i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review."
84,B001LXYA5Q,3,1300838400,"This tablet which is referred to as the miracle berry is used to distort taste of unpleasant(to you) items. You can let 1 dissolve in your mouth,swishing around once or twice, then bite a lemon and it taste sweet. It is an odd sort of sweet. It comes with a list of items you can use it with, lemons,strawberries,cheese. I was using it to try and mask the taste of the salt water flush while doing the master cleanse. It DOES NOT mask salt water. Not sure of a use I'd have for it. It does what it claims, just not needed for me."
85,B001LXYA5Q,4,1273795200,"In reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently.  At first I believed the tablets did nothing even though I used a whole one.  Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.  It was when I drank pure lemon juice that I noticed a difference.  Pure lemon tasted like lemonade.  So the product does work, it just may not work exactly as advertised for you."
86,B001LXYA5Q,2,1350345600,"I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.<br /><br />This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.<br /><br />I would not suggest this version of the product, other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries."
87,B001LXYA5Q,2,1334966400,"Quite disappointed. The pills don't last that long (it wears off after a few tries per pill) and not all the food items on the suggested list works. E.g. Cheese. Maybe it was a bad batch, but I'm not taking the risk to purchase it again."
88,B001LXYA5Q,3,1332460800,"I tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations. Most tasted slightly different. Some got a sweet tickling in the mouth. I got the strongest effects from vinegar, ketchup/mustard and Salt-vinegar chips. But nothing tasted miraculously better as I had expected. As others have pointed out, everyone reacts differently. The two other people I did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well. One experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me. You could try this if you are interested but I wouldn't buy it again."
89,B001LXYA5Q,2,1324684800,Worked very little. Sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter.<br />A sour orange it did help. It didn't work on anything else at all.
90,B001LXYA5Q,5,1305504000,"This stuff really works, makes lemons taste sweet.  Gave to a friend, she loved it and ordered 3 to give to her friends.  Great party idea, try mberry with all sorts of foods, will change their flavor, fun to experiment."
91,B001LXYA5Q,2,1294704000,"First of all, these things taste pretty bad. If you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue, maybe it wouldn't be AS bad. But I really didn't notice much change in the taste of foods. Lemons tasted sweet, but that's all I noticed. I considered trying two at a time, but they just tasted so bad to me that I have never used them again."
92,B001LXYA5Q,5,1270512000,this is quite neat!  i could drink a glass of vinegar and it would taste just like syrup!  it is certainly worth trying.
93,B001LXYA5Q,2,1262736000,"After reading the reviews on Amazon and researching food ideas online I got some friends together and we all divulged.  Out of the seven of us who took it, three of us just felt sick after the process.  All of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us, they were not necessarily good tricks.  I wouldn't say sour things tasted sweet for instance, I would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones.  The only thing I tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a Coors light.  It tasted like a pretty good Pilsner after the pill, and everyone seemed to like this, but sometimes a nice cold Coors light is just what you need, so...  If you have nothing left to spend your money on, this isn't the worst choice in the world, but don't expect a miracle, because that is not going to happen.  Expect a stomach ache, a loss of appetite, and then you won't find disappointment."
94,B001LXYA5Q,1,1325894400,"My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was."
95,B001LXYA5Q,1,1274400000,"I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we'd seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever. We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead."
96,B001LXYA5Q,1,1296086400,"After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.<br /><br />Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again."
97,B001LXYA5Q,2,1346198400,"StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money."
98,B001LXYA5Q,2,1331596800,"Not worth the cost.<br /><br />I have only had these as free samples.<br /><br />I would pay $5 for a pack of 10. I may even be willing to pay $10.00 for a pack of 10.<br />Anything more than $10 is total robbery.<br /><br />So, obviously, $17.99 is WAY too much.<br /><br />This product is SUPER cool, and I LOVED how it worked.<br /><br />But, really? $18.00?<br /><br />Mberry should Market their product as a food enhancer, not as a ""Flavor tripping experience"".<br /><br />If Mberry does that, and prices their products reasonably, it WILL gain customers.<br /><br />Keeping there product around as a ""Flavor tripping experience"" will surely make it a passing fad."
99,B001LXYA5Q,3,1276041600,"I bought these tablets to try during lunch at work. Four of us each tried one tablet, tasted various foods, and noticed no difference. At that point, I gave up, but two intrepid friends went on to try four tablets each. They reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried, but many items remained unaffected. Among those that were was a fruit punch Powerade reported to taste so sweet as to be very repulsive (like drinking pure sugar), and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven. Most other affected foods were impacted negatively.<br /><br />In all, we were unimpressed with these tablets. While they did accomplish their flavor-changing purpose, it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable. And the experience, though fun, was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required. I was really hoping for a bigger impact."
100,B001LXYA5Q,2,1268697600,"My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q"">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the ""sweetest"" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but don't expect too much."
101,B004P4TL8E,5,1303948800,Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height). Cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what K-Cups you may want.
102,B004P4TL8E,3,1303516800,"It is a nice looking storage option and saves space, but I expected the drawer to slide out without so much difficulty. It is very jerky and tough to pull out and and push in. I thought maybe I did something wrong but it is pretty simple. I applied some WD 40 to the slide (with much wiping to get the excess off) and that did not help.<br />Has anyone else had this trouble, and were you able to remedy it?"
103,B004P4TL8E,1,1314489600,Cost was $48 at time of review.  Only $25 at other sites .... buy elsewhere!  Sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two. I will be comparison shopping a little more now.
104,B004P4TL8E,2,1313107200,"This sells for $29.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Add your 20% off coupon and you're good to go ...<br /><br />I also had cabinet issues and returned it to BB&B."
105,B004P4TL8E,2,1305849600,"When I received this item, I was very disappointed with it. It is rather cheap looking and I wouldn't want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out. Needless to say I boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund. Definitely not worth $25.00, but after seeing it I would have been equally disappointed had I paid only $10.00."
106,B004P4TL8E,3,1331164800,"I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.<br /><br />I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k-cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k-cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer."
107,B004P4TL8E,5,1317859200,The drawer fit perfectly and is a real space saver!  It is just the right size and holds all our coffee choices.
108,B004P4TL8E,4,1313020800,This is an extremely useful product. The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 is I should have looked closer on the dimensions and the width of my cabinets....
109,B004P4TL8E,4,1304467200,"Before I begin my review, let me say this... I read the product specs, ESPECIALLY THE DIMENSIONS...<br />I measured the space I have, and armed with that knowledge, I ordered the item.<br /><br />The item is exactly as described and pictured... and because I pre-measured, I KNEW it would fit (unlike other reviewers who apparently couldn't be bothered, and then give it a low-rating as a result).<br /><br />It's a simple design, and well built.  It's sturdy enough to hold the weight of my LARGE Cuisinart k-cup brewer, with a full reservoir.  It's a solid wire-frame build, and the rails the drawer runs on are part of that wire-design.  The mesh walls are a tad light-weight, but they aren't load-bearing, and are only meant for aesthetics and to contain the k-cups. (I also store Splenda packets in one column of mine.)<br /><br />Other than my 'normal' blend, I tend to have up to 5 additional flavors for a weekend treat, or just to mix it up on occasion... keeping these loose on the counter, or bouncing around mixed up in a box made it a pain to pick through them... but now I keep them in line in the segmented rows in the drawer.  Having a lack of storage space in my cupboards and kitchen drawers makes this the natural and ideal choice.<br /><br />Many have been disappointed that it didn't ""fit"" -- but all you need to do is measure your brewer's footprint, and it's height beneath your cupboards (if applicable).<br /><br />It's not a PERFECT item (the mesh could be a tad better grade, or the price about $5 lower) but otherwise highly recommended purchase."
110,B004P4TL8E,1,1312848000,"I purchased this item and then saw it for $20 less in a big retail store.  When I contacted Amazon I was told that they couldn't do anything for me and the price I paid was firm.  I wrote them and told them I was going to return the item and buy it where I had seen it for much cheaper and they just didn't care.  When I asked how much my refund was going to be they told me approximately $3.00 more than what they had credited me for.  I don't like to be deceived and I thought you get the best prices with Amazon, but that is not true at all.  Keep checking other places before you purchase from Amazon and there Customer Service stinks in my opinion.  Furthermore, I received my item from the other place and I love it!"
111,B004P4TL8E,4,1299715200,"So, I bought the Coffee Pod Drawer thinking it was the answer to my cluttered coffee area on my kitchen counter.  Not exactly.  First and foremost, let me say - this is a great product.  It does hold the pods neatly.  It has a nice, durable, slip resistant top that lets you feel comfortable that your Keurig won't slip or tip over. This is why I gave the product 4 stars.<br />My issue is this:  I purchased this simply because I thought it would use up less space on my counter if my K-Cups were stored inside this drawer and underneath my Keurig, as opposed to my (somewhat) bulky K-Cup Carousel.  (Which by the way, is chrome, and I really despise chrome.)  Anyways, what I did not consider was the fact that it raises your Keurig up by about 3.25 inches.  Before I bought this drawer, my Keurig had just enough space on the counter under the cupboard that it sits under, for me to lift the top of the Keurig open to put new K-Cups in, and to fill the water, etc.  That additional 3.25 inches really makes a difference.  I can no longer open the top of the Keurig all the way without banging the cupboard.  We all know that you don't NEED to open it all of the way, but when that's what you were used to doing, well, you can understand...  I pretty much bang the cupboard every day now.  Another drawback to the idea of purchasing this soley to save space, is that you can't keep anything in front of the drawer, since obviously, you need to open the drawer to get the K-Cups out. I used to keep the coffee condiments in front of my Keurig, and now I can't.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: This is a great product in the sense that it gets the carousel (if you have one) off your counters.  But, I would only buy this if 1.) You have ample clearance above your Keurig now to be able to still lift the top open once you set this up, and 2.) You don't need to use the space in front of the drawer.<br /><br />Happy Coffee Drinking!<br /><br />Update:  02/20/12:<br />Almost a year later - I am still using the Storage Drawer.  Yes, from time to time I forget and still whack the cupboard, but the Keurig and the cupboard are no worse for the wear.  I still keep my eye out for better storage solutions, and none have really looked like they would be any better.  While the product is well made and has been durable (still looking practically new, and is heavily used in my kitchen) - I still think it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I just checked online and it still ranges from $25 to $45.  (I am hoping that nobody pays $45 for this when you can get it for $24.99, plus use a coupon for 20% off at Bed Bath and Beyond.)<br />Of all the reviews I have written on Amazon, this one seems to bring some not so nice comments from people. Which is kind of odd to me.  But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I still hold firm at 4 stars.  As I mentioned in a reply to one comment - to me, that's a B+. There's nothing wrong with a B+ product.  I think most people that buy this product will be very impressed with it's durability.  Thanks for reading!"

113,B004P4TL8E,5,1299801600,"I can finally get rid of the five boxes of K-cups sitting on my counter.  The padded top of the drawer shelf means I don't get a rattling vibration noise when the brewer runs, and the drawer slide action is very smooth.  The drawer extends far enough out that it's easy to get the last cup in a row, so you can see all the cups at once - much better than digging around in a bunch of boxes.  The whole thing feels very sturdy, and has a nice modern look to it."
114,B004P4TL8E,5,1321315200,"This is an excellent K-cup storage drawer. It holds the cups nicely. The drawer is a bit sturdy and supports the weight of the machine. It is easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this product to a loved one. However, I would also recommend that they purchase it elsewhere! I purchased the exact item at my local BB&B for 24.99 this past Sunday. That is almost half price."
115,B004P4TL8E,4,1306972800,"Where do you put your k-cups? Right F'ing here. That's where.<br /><br />This thing is solid and doesn't slide around on the counter-top plus it's sturdy enough to handle the Platinum Keurig without issue and it looks saucey too.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars as the slider tray was/is a little bent. Only noticeable if you're right up next to it. Definitely not the packaging or shipping damage, looks like it came from the factory this way.<br /><br />**also, since its of stock from this store, you can find it at Bed Bad Beyond for $25**"
116,B004P4TL8E,2,1343088000,"Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesn't open/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I weren't terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it."
117,B004P4TL8E,5,1309996800,"I store my mugs, creamer, splenda packets and napkins on top of this  and just love it. My coffee maker is next to it (it's like my little coffee station :-)) I didn't buy it here though because it's CHEAPER at Bed Bath & Beyond (24.99 + 5.99 shipping = 30.98) Here it's 47.95. I am gonna get a 2nd one to stack on top of my first and then put the same stuff i had on it back on top. I recommend this stackable drawer type unit.<br /><br />[....]"
118,B004P4TL8E,3,1306108800,"First off I very much prefer this look to the rotating holders, plus it holds MORE K cups than they do.  I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.<br />A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.<br />I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it's appeal.<br />I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all."
119,B004P4TL8E,5,1300752000,"This drawer is fabulous and holds a TON of kcups. It does make the machine too tall for low-hanging cabinets. However, it saves on total counter space needed (versus a carousel) and looks great. It is very sturdy and should last for a long time. I have the Keurig Platinum and have plenty of room to put sugar/Splenda packets or mugs. Love it!"
120,B004P4TL8E,1,1327881600,"I have one of these and love it but I would never pay this much for it.  Got it a Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $24.99 and that was not a sale, just their regular price."
121,B004P4TL8E,5,1303516800,"I have this drawer and the carousel, I find it easier and less cluttered to use the drawer. I also have my Keurig on top of it with lots of room around it for misc items."
122,B004P4TL8E,5,1299542400,"This item is great. I dont have a lot of counter space in my kitchen or space in my draws to store my k-cups, so this item was perfect for me. It sits right below my keurig. I would highly recommend this item. A Great Buy and An Awesome Space Saver!"
123,B004P4TL8E,4,1320105600,"Able to store my coffee right under the machine. I still have room on top for my soda maker (Keurig is a mini).<br />The only thing I don't like is that the pods that are in the back may be a little difficult to get. Would be better if there was a spring that would push these last pods forward slightly as the others get used. Other wise. much more useful than a carousel.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, can get this item for $25 at Bed bath.. and with usual 20% off coupons, for even less. It also does raise the Keurig about 3"" from the counter. So be sure to have room above the coffee maker as well as on the sides"
124,B004P4TL8E,4,1319414400,"As other's have mentioned, this is available in other stores for much cheaper so I recommend to shop around before buying on Amazon.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual product, I highly recommend buying this if you own a Keurig. You are able to discretly hide so many of the Keurig cups. The carousel is a neat product but when you don't have counter space, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />This unit is pretty great quality but I do find that it is tough to slide sometimes. The material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your Keurig doesn't move at all.<br /><br />Highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from BBB or Amazon!"
125,B004P4TL8E,4,1314057600,"I have a rather small kitchen and a ""Tower"" type holder would take up too much counter space.  This holder is perfect for me - the rubberized top holds my Keurig plus a sugar dispenser, a bowl of Sweet-n-Low, and a tall shot glass with coffee stir sticks.  Very convenient, and the drawer slides out easily to hold 36 K-cups.  I'm thinking of getting a 2nd one and stacking them so that I have room for 72 cups, clearance above my Keurig is good.<br /><br />4-stars for price, at ~$45 I had to really think about it for a bit.  But, it works better for me than the cheaper options would so I am happy with the purchase."
126,B004P4TL8E,5,1308009600,"Like a lot of people, I have very limited kitchen space, and my Keurig brewer itself takes up an entire countertop. I was never able to fit one of the traditional revolving K-cup stands in my kitchen, so I generally leave my K-cup boxes on top of the refrigerator. Not very tidy and a little inconvenient, but the best I could do. I was thrilled to find this holder at the store (where it cost about $25 - beware some of these Amazon seller prices!) and bought it immediately. It's perfect! It holds 36 K-cups at a time, so I can stock it and put the K-cups away in the closet for a few weeks until I start running low. It also complements my black and silver brewer nicely. It's very stable and has a no-slip top so you don't have to worry about your Keurig tipping over. It does add about 4 inches of height, so make sure you have enough clearance if your brewer is under a cupboard. Highly recommended."
127,B004P4TL8E,5,1302825600,Plain and simple. All you have to do is buy this drawer and set your coffee maker on top of it AND you are done. Easy to get your k-cups whenever brewing coffee. Right at your fingertips.
128,B004P4TL8E,5,1348272000,"GREAT WAY TO STOCK YOUR K-CUP ASSORTMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE UP EXTRA COUNTERSPACE W/ANOTHER ITEM SUCH AS THE CAROUSEL OR TOWER UNITS OFFERED, IF YOUR KITCHEN IS SMALL."
129,B004P4TL8E,1,1329350400,"Item appears to be Keurig brand by title & description (big $$$).  However upon receiving it, it is an off brand ""My Perfect Kitchen"" sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and at HALF the price. I was disappointed in the jading and sent it back. Signed up for BBB email promos and got a 20% off coupon for use in the store so I bought this EXACT item for $20 (reg only $24.99 in store).  I mean EXACT!  Do your homework and save yourself some money.  Oh and the item itself is great...we have the larger Platinum B70 and it does have an issue with the cupboards but I just pulled it forward about 3.5in and it's perfect.  I am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and I may move it to an open top area so for us it's all good :)"
130,B004P4TL8E,5,1325116800,This is a great product....HOWEVER it is only about 25.00 at Bed Bath and Beyond and if you look in the Sunday paper always a 20% off coupon.
131,B004P4TL8E,5,1317859200,"The Keurig storage drawer is a perfect match for the coffee maker, the coffee machine sits perfectly on the top and makes getting the refills soooo easy.<br />I looked at other storage options but I found this to be Ideal. Really glad I bought it."
132,B004P4TL8E,5,1313280000,"I was ready to buy one of the carousel type k-cup storage devices when I saw this one.<br />It is a bit exepnsive, but it preserves counter space and keeps the k-cups right there.<br />I also use it to store the EZ cup reusable system."
133,B004P4TL8E,5,1307059200,"This was a gift for our daughter. She loves it,since it holds more cups than the carousel. She loads in her favorites in the front part, and less used flavors in the rear. The only drawback might be is that if your cabinets hang low over your countertop, you may have difficulty with the added inch or two in height, since the brewer sits on top of the drawer."
134,B004P4TL8E,3,1306454400,"Ordered this on the advice of the Single Serve Coffee forum.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh, so it doesn't slide smoothly.  It's pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close.<br />It doesn't pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K-Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top.<br />Again, all mesh, so the cups don't sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly.<br />My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didn't leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />For our modern kitchen, it's nice to look at.<br />It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space.<br />When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.<br /><br />All in all, for $25 it's a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I don't need my coffee to be on display.  Plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus."
135,B004P4TL8E,5,1305936000,I love this drawer. My Keurig Cuisinart Coffeemaker fits on it perfectly. It holds 36 K-cups so I always have many options for hot beverages right where I need them. I think it looks great and the drawer slides in and out very easily. Don't know how they could have made this simple item any better.
136,B004P4TL8E,5,1302825600,"I just got a Keurig for my mom who is 82 and disabled. It is so much easier now for her to get her cup of coffee and tea. I read over many reviews to decide whether to buy the carousel or this storage drawer. I finally decided on this for the space saving design. It was the right choice. It is sturdy, durable and somewhat attractive. It slides out smooth and quiet, and holds a nice amount of cups. It pulls out far enough so you can see the cups far in the back of the drawer. I am hoping that they will make one that has 2 drawers, one on top of the other, so I could store more cups at a time. This isn't beautiful if your looking at the aesthetic value of it, but works for what it is intended for."
137,B004P4TL8E,5,1351036800,When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I couldn't decide how to store the K-cups. I didn't want to give<br />up my counter space for the carousel. I settled for a flat holder that with open compartments and could be<br />put in a drawer or attached to the wall. I didn't want to spend the extra few dollars for this drawer type.<br />After shifting that one around from drawer to balanced against the wall I finally gave in and went for this great holder that allows the Keurig to sit on top and now I have my counter space back and a nice neat area for my<br />Keurig. I hope that I can save someone some time and money by letting you know about my experience.
138,B004P4TL8E,5,1349222400,"Storage drawer is very handy to keep under the Keurig, instead of having sevaral boxes of K-cups. It is sturdy, however one of the adhesive foot pads came off (just stuck it back on) from moving the whole thing back and forth to open the pod lid wide enough."
139,B004P4TL8E,5,1349222400,A birthday gift to myself. My hubby gave me the Keurig for Christmas. And I was having a hard time storing all my flavors of the K-Cups. I love this for you pull it out and there they are ....flavors and all. Good construction too. And it all fits under my cabinet with room to open and fill the reservoir.
140,B004P4TL8E,1,1349222400,Drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface. The drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed. I would not purchase again.
141,B004P4TL8E,5,1348876800,Bought this as a gift for my mom because she loved mine. It arrived very quickly and was just what she wanted. Thanks!!
142,B004P4TL8E,3,1348358400,First off I'm very happy that my Keurig Coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space. But on the other hand it's difficult to reach the last K-cup in the very back of the drawer. I can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access.
143,B004P4TL8E,4,1348099200,"The slots wernt exactly evenly spaced and its a bit stiff to pull out/push in. But bottom line it works! And looks good! For the price, can't beat it."
144,B004P4TL8E,5,1348012800,The Keurig fits nicely on top of the drawer.  The drawer opens and closes with ease. It organizes your K-cups and saves counter shape.
145,B004P4TL8E,5,1347840000,"My daughter has and enjoys this storage drawer.  Based on her recommendation, I ordered it and am very glad I did.  It looks nice, holds a lot of cups, and is very convenient.  Highly recommend."
146,B004P4TL8E,4,1347753600,"I Decided to fasten it under our cabinet to save more space. It is very sturdy, well made, and works great,"
147,B004P4TL8E,5,1347667200,"Love this!  It saves space and looks great.  I had to move the brewer out a litle bit from under my cabinets to be able to open the top, but otherwise no problem.  There's even enough room on top of the drawer to put my sweetener in a small holder."
148,B004P4TL8E,4,1347580800,"I love that this drawer holds so many k-cups! Its great to have them right under the machine. Its great for those times when I am having company, I can load it up with what I know they like. Each time someone different comes over, I can just simply put their choices in the drawer and they can make a fresh beverage any time they want, they dont need to dig in my pantry or come get me to make something for them. Handy to have! I love it!"
149,B004P4TL8E,4,1347494400,My husband drilled some extra holes and mounted it under a cabinet.  It holds more than my carousel and you can see all the flavors at once. The hard mesh sides and front allows you to easily check the coffee supply without opening the drawer. There were no sharp edges on the metal  Looks like it will hold up well.  A good value for the money.
150,B004P4TL8E,5,1347494400,My order arrived quickly and was packaged well and well worth the price. I like it better than the stand up K-cup holder because this goes right under the coffee maker and doesn't take up extra space. The drawer slides in and out smoothly too.
151,B004P4TL8E,3,1347408000,"I don't know if I have bad one (doubt it), but it doesn't slide well unless you lift up on it.  It's like the tracks are too tight, and if you try pulling straight out, it hangs, and then the cups inside go flying when it finally does slide because you end up jerking it."
152,B004P4TL8E,4,1347321600,I bought this for my office. It was perfect because it fits just right on the mini fridge with room for my mugs on the side. We love it because you can now see what to pick from when before we were going through boxes of k-cups.
153,B004P4TL8E,5,1347062400,"This drawer is very sturdy (as long as it's on a flat surface) and holds plenty of K cups. It's great because it doesn't use your counter space and even with my heavy CuisinArt K cup coffee maker on top, it still slides in and out very easily. Love it!"
154,B004P4TL8E,5,1346976000,"I had been frustrated trying to figure out how to store the K-cups on my counter top.  The carousals were not only spendy, but took up too much space.  I love this product.  Yes it does raise my machine up....but isn't that to be expected when it goes under the machine? I get a kick out of people putting down a product when it is exactly as described and the reviewer didn't have the foresight to see this. Besides, mine does not sit under the cupboard, so its not a problem.  The drawer slides easily and the top does not sag or buckle under the weight.  It is perfect for my limited space. I would like to find one just like this one, but a little smaller for my smaller machine at work."
155,B004P4TL8E,5,1346976000,The product arrived quickly.  It was just perfect and although it says it holds 36 K-cups - it actually holds MORE if you turn every other one upside down!  We have our coffee maker sitting on top and just love the convenience of the coffee right there. THANKS for a great product.
156,B004P4TL8E,5,1346976000,I received the Keurig K-Cup shelf and it is a perfect addition to the Keurig coffee maker and allows you to have 40 or so K-cups nearby without having to look at them (like you would have with the K-Cup tree).
157,B004P4TL8E,5,1346803200,"Sturdy. well made. convenient. Fits well under the Keurig machine and does not take extra space, Easy pull out drawer to view coffee choices"
158,B004P4TL8E,5,1346716800,"This drawer is just awesome for holding the K-cups when the boxes get nearly empty, and it seems pointless to store them on the shelf.  It keeps the k-cups nice and dry and handy.  Best of all is that the machine can rest safely on the top, giving it it's own little area in the kitchen, kind of like a little break room.  We love this, and the shelf we bought to hang on the wall to hold the boxes."
159,B004P4TL8E,2,1345766400,Ordered 2 both had bent tracks and I actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out. But you get what you pay for....
160,B004P4TL8E,5,1344902400,"Works great. Definitely worth the $21.38. I read another review that the drawer sticks. I ran into this problem also. Easy fix, just bend the sides of the pull out drawer in (with a little bit of pressure). I was afraid that I might break it, but it seems to be very sturdy. Like I said just a little bit of pressure & the drawer slides out no problem. Believe me if it had issues I would never hear the end of it from my wife. Also I have my Keurig B40 on top of it with no issues of bowing, & there is enough room on the side to fit some containers ""Creamer & Sugar"". Makes the counter top a lot more functional."
161,B004P4TL8E,5,1344816000,This is very sturdy and not as some reviews were that stated this was flimsy.<br />I have no issues with it at all and would highly recommend it to anyone of my friends.
162,B004P4TL8E,2,1344124800,"Looks good, but does not open and close smoothly.  The drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track.  The tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out."
163,B004P4TL8E,5,1343952000,My order was processed quickly and arrived on time. Slide it out of the box and set it in place. Now everything is at my finger tips.
164,B004P4TL8E,5,1343692800,Good solid product.  Saves room when storing your k cups.  One thing to check is the space under your cabinet.  My Keurig is on my kitchen counter and I had to pull it out from under the cabinet since the tray would not open with the extra height.
165,B004P4TL8E,5,1341792000,"This item works  out great!!!Keeps everycup of coffee at your fingertips, and definitely looks good sitting on my unclutterd counter.!!  Quick ship...AAAA+++++"
166,B004P4TL8E,5,1341792000,Great storage for coffee and space saver.  May purchase another to stack them as we have enough space under cabinet.
167,B004P4TL8E,5,1341187200,"This is an attractive way to store all those k-cups, and they are right under the machine, never lost or mixed up.  The shelf pretty much matches any decor and the drawer does not rub or stick.  I love it."
168,B004P4TL8E,1,1340928000,"I have never taken the time to write a review before, but in this case others need to be warned off. I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very ""sticky"" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best."
169,B004P4TL8E,5,1340236800,"This product is well worth the money.  Others carry a similar product that's cheaper, but the quality is way cheaper also."
170,B004P4TL8E,5,1339718400,"I am giving this 5 stars, not because it fits the way it ""should"" but because I love it where I put it.  First, this does not fit under my Keurig properly, my lid to the Keurig will not open all the way if this sits UNDER the machine.  This is a quality piece-it does not feel flimsy or a crappy build.  The drawer works smooth with no problems.  The K-Cups fit perfectly!  The reason I love it is I had my husband drill a few holes and mounted it under my counter (in the corner where the cupboards meet).  (I uploaded two pictures under images for you to see what I mean).  This works GREAT as an under the counter holder.  I warn you, measure your cupboards first, some of my cupboards were not deep enough to install this as an ""under counter"" product.  However, the ""corner"" where my cupboards meet worked super.  I love that it's ""off"" my counter but it actuallly looks nice and keeps all the cups in a space that is easy to use and does not take up precious counter space in my small kitchen!"
171,B004P4TL8E,4,1335052800,Nice storage drawer..matches nicely in my kitchen...only drawback is I can't store it under the coffee maker due to not be able to open the keurig dispenser so I store it under my toaster.  Other than that it's really nice.
172,B004P4TL8E,5,1334275200,I bought this one until I saw one exactly like it at a big box store (think red bullseye) for 24.99. This is going back!
173,B004P4TL8E,2,1331424000,I've been looking at this holder since I saw it at the at my office. Today I found it at BB&B for $24. It works great but too expensive at Amozon.
174,B004P4TL8E,5,1330819200,"If you like gadget, this is one more to add to your collection.<br />It works and fits nicely on a counter top.  You can then<br />put the machine on top of this drawer, saving space.<br />It glides smoothly."
175,B004P4TL8E,4,1328486400,"Coffee maker nicely stacks on top of drawer saving counter space.<br />I bought two since I keep a wide variety of K-cups.<br />However, I purchased mine at Bed, Bath and Beyond for about half the price."
176,B004P4TL8E,5,1328486400,I was not particularly happy with the storage drawer as it is made of wire and the cups don't sit in it flat.
177,B004P4TL8E,4,1328054400,Works well with my Keurig Cofee Maker. Always have K-cups handy. Uses less space than the other types of holders. glad I ordered this item.
178,B004P4TL8E,5,1327795200,I use my storage drawer for my assorted k- cups and my Keurig sits ATP the storage drawer. It has an easy clean top and is attractive and practical.
179,B004P4TL8E,5,1327795200,We love this tray. It is very sturdy and holds just enough K cups. I would recommend this to everyone
180,B004P4TL8E,4,1327449600,"I purchased this storage drawer so that I could better organize my mass of K-Cups. It currently sits underneath my Keurig. It looks very nice and does what it is supposed to. It is a simple design and while it doesn't save a lot of room, it doesn't take up much room either."
181,B004P4TL8E,5,1326499200,Tray fits perfectly under the coffee maker.  Color compliments color of coffee maker.  Non-skid top keeps coffee maker in place. Drawer is ventilated.  Ample storage space.  Love it.
182,B004P4TL8E,5,1326412800,"I love products that reduce clutter, are functional, and don't hurt your eyes to look at. I really like this drawer. I have it beneath my Cuisinart Keurig K-Cup Mini Brewing System. It's sturdy enough to hold the coffee maker. This is a product I would highly recommend!!"
183,B004P4TL8E,5,1326153600,A wonderfully ingenious way to keep all your K-cups in one place without taking up extra counter space! Keeps several different types of my favorite coffee.  I love it!
184,B004P4TL8E,4,1324598400,"What a great idea!  I hated wasting a whole drawer with my various K-cup boxes (tea, cider, coffees, etc).  I thought about the carousels, but didn't like the idea of having it on my counter.  I wanted something that was more: 1) discreet; and 2) space saving.<br /><br />1) More discreet: Yes!<br />It looks nice and you can't even tell what is in it.<br /><br />2) Space saving: Yes!<br />My Keurig B60 fits perfectly on it.<br /><br />I hate having cluttered looking counter tops.  This drawer allows me to store my cups neatly, in a unit that looks nice.  I also love how it has dividers for each row to allow you to organize your K-cups.  You cna slo pull the drawer out pretty far, so that you can see all of your k-cups.  I also LOVE that I get my drawer (where my k-cups were previously stored) back!<br /><br />I do wish that the top of it looked a little nicer. The black, spongy material on the top looks a little cheap. Because most of it is covered with the Keurig, you don't really see much of it anyway, so it isn't a big deal at all.  But, the material is a bit on the cheaper side - still nice though!<br /><br />Additional Notes - Things that were mentioned by previous posters already, but that bear repeating:<br /><br />1) Beware: With your keurig on top of it, you may not be able to open the top.<br />I wasn't thinking (and failed to read one of the reviews that mentioned this) and got this without realizing this.  Duh!  Sure enough, I can't open the top with my keurig on the drawer.  Ooops.  No biggie though - someone commented with a great idea: Put felt on the bottom of the drawer so that you can easily slide the entire unit out when you need to use your keuirg. I plan to do this.<br /><br />2) It is MUCH cheaper elsewhere.<br />At the time of this review, it is listed on Amazon for almost $50.  But, thanks to a previous reviewer, I found it on Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $25...and, I got free shipping too!!!"
185,B004P4TL8E,5,1324598400,"looked all over for this. great space saver.  keeps the pods neat. water proof top is great for me, keeps me from soaking the kcups"
186,B004P4TL8E,4,1324339200,"Pros:<br />This is a fairly simple product.  A metal drawer with dividers. Great for organizing all the your K-cups. Less counter space than a carousel.<br /><br />Cons:<br />EXPENSIVE...A metal drawer with dividers for almost $50.  It raises your coffee maker about 3.25"".  We have a Keurig B60 and when it is placed on this product and shoved back towards the wall it will not open fully to accept the K-cup because of the wall cabinets it resides under.  Its not a big deal to just pull the unit forward but I think its definitely worth mentioning."
187,B004P4TL8E,5,1322179200,"Here is the perfect solution for storing K cups until you need them.  It holds 36 K cups and there is plenty of room for ""his"", ""hers"" and ""theirs.<br /><br />This unit is well built, light in weight, perfectly functional in design and low enough so you can put your Keurig coffee maker on top of it and still put it under your overhead kitchen cabinets."
188,B004P4TL8E,5,1311897600,"This is so nice to have when space is limited.  Because of the height of our cabinets we were not able to place this under the machine, but have it on the side with our other coffee making supplies on top.  It stores plenty of Kcups for easy use. Much better for us than a stand."
189,B004P4TL8E,5,1309737600,This is my second purchase.  I have so many varieties of tea and coffee that one was not enough space.  They stack nicely next to my Keurig.
190,B004P4TL8E,5,1308960000,"Not only does this store all those annoying little Kcups, but I put sugar packs and creamers it it too.  The black top is great because it doesn't show every little splash of coffee. A much better solution that the tree-type stands!"
191,B004P4TL8E,5,1306800000,"When I originally started looking to buy a Keurig, it was a deal that came with this drawer.  I thought it seemed like a great idea immediately.  I ended up waiting a couple more months before I bought my Keurig and it no longer came with the drawer.  I looked everywhere for the drawer because I liked how it kept the cups hidden from view, but still handy like one of the carousels.  I couldn't find the drawer - it was sold out everywhere I looked for a month.  I finally found it on Amazon, and at a good price.  The drawer has lived up to my expectations.  I keep my Keurig in an area where there are no upper cabinets, so I don't have trouble with it being higher now.  I also alternate K-cups facing up and down so I can get more in the drawer.  I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a way to keep K-cups within easy reach, organized, and hidden."
192,B004P4TL8E,5,1306713600,This storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop. We can either set the Keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k-cups where people can get at them easily. Totally satisfied!
193,B004P4TL8E,5,1306368000,"Saw this at a local big-box chain store, so of course I had to look for it on Amazon as soon as I got home. Received the item in 2 days (Prime really rocks, doesn't it?) and am so happy; we can finally get rid of our K-cup carousel.<br /><br />This drawer holds more K-cups and keeps them out of sight, freeing countertop real estate. It glides open smoothly and seems very well made. It was shipped in a nice sturdy box and arrived in excellent condition. The drawer has 6 divided sections, each of which holds 6 K-cups. Perfect for us, since we like variety! The drawer doesn't pull completely out, but has a built-in stop; it doesn't seem to make it harder to get the last K-cup out, at least for me. I'm a female with average lady-fingers. YMMV. Still, I like the stop, I wouldn't want to have K-cups rolling all over the kitchen floor.<br /><br />Note - if you keep your machine under upper cabinets, you'll likely need to pull it out away from the wall to allow enough clearance to insert K-cups and fill the reservoir. We just turned our unused kitchen desktop (it's counter is 3-4"" lower) into a coffee station.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry the T-disc version of this drawer, so tomorrow it's back to the store to buy one of those. Got to keep my Tassimo machine happy, too!<br /><br />This product is a no-brainer!"
194,B004P4TL8E,5,1306281600,This is a great idea and a well made product.  It just seems to me that it was a no brainer to slide the whole thing out from under the cupboard.  This item is a great space saver.
195,B004P4TL8E,5,1305849600,"Until I found this item, I was taking up valuable storage space in my overhead cabinet with 3 boxes of K-cups.  (I like variety!)  This tray is sturdy, holds plenty of K-cups, and basically disappears from view once you put it under your Keurig.  I love it so much that I ordered one for my cousin - we both grew up reciting ""a place for everything, and everything in it's place"" - guess what?  She loves it, too!  If you're lamenting having bought the carousel, simply sell it at your next garage sale and give this tray a try!"
196,B004P4TL8E,5,1305676800,"K-cup storage drawer is great.  I have the carousel, but wanted additional K cup storage.  The drawer fits the bill, and takes up no additional space since it sits underneath the Keurig Brewer.  No more K Cup boxes to hide somewhere."
197,B004P4TL8E,5,1305676800,"I was originally looking for Keurig coffee on Amazon and stumbled across this gem.  I bought it for work to centralize my coffee ""stuff"" and it has been perfect - k-cups, stirrers, sweetener packets, all fit nicely in one place...right below my Keurig!  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the dividers in the drawer were solid so stirrers didn't have a chance to roll around, but since I can tell it was originally designed to only hold k-cups I can't complain.  Great for saving space and looks nicer than the tall, spice rack looking k-cup holders out there - would def recommend."
198,B004P4TL8E,5,1305331200,"I purchased this holder after seeing it in an open house and I just had to have one. Very well built and engineered. The drawer slides very easy and it holds more K-cups than I expected. Overall, a great design with no disappointments. Definitely recommend buying one since it takes up no more space than the coffee maker itself."
199,B004P4TL8E,4,1304985600,Good storage of the K-Cups as well as enough storage so that it can support my Keurig coffee maker.  It easily solved the problem of how to store all my K-Cups much better than the rotating tower.
200,B004P4TL8E,5,1304380800,"We're neat people and keep our counter clear so this works great for us. It is well made, slides easily, and loads in a minute... also cups don't catch sunlight like the vertical racks would in our bright kitchen."
201,B002TMV34E,4,1277596800,"Many coffee containers, whether they're bags or cans, tell you what you'll be getting inside.  Although there is ample advertising and promotional information printed on the bag, I was left clueless as to where the arabica beans were grown.  That's why I called this ""mystery coffee.""  My usual brew is made from freshly-ground, all Colombian grown 100% arabica beans from a top-rated coffee supplier.<br /><br />Since I'm a serious coffee drinker, I would not usually buy such small bags of it.  An 11-ounce bag will make about three full 10-cup pots of coffee for me at the strength that I usually brew (1 level tablespoon full of ground coffee per cup brewed which is half-again more than Melitta recommends).  Melitta used such a strong adhesive to seal the bag, I had to nearly destroy the top of the bag to get into it.  Once opened, the bag yielded a hearty, pleasant fragrance of freshly-ground coffee.  I expected that it would brew good-tasting coffee with a bold taste and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Melitta recommends using their brand of filters because they've ground the coffee finely to extract the maximum flavor, but my usual store-brand filters worked just fine.  If your coffee preference is for bold but not bitter over mild you'll probably find this coffee to be satisfying; more like Starbucks than Dunkin' Donuts coffee.<br /><br />Ultimately choosing a favorite brand of coffee, for most people, is a matter of taste and cost.  This collection is certainly worth considering if you like your brew to be potent and to actually taste like coffee instead of like something else or wish to share this tasty coffee experience by giving one of these small bags as a gift.  I enjoyed this coffee but wouldn't buy such small bags of it regularly for my own consumption.  My top-rated bean coffee comes in more convenient packaging and costs me less."
202,B002TMV34E,2,1277251200,"I don't enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a Melitta coffee maker for it's full potential.<br /><br />I've made 3 pots:<br /><br />First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called ""Eight O'Clock"" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better."
203,B002TMV34E,5,1264896000,"I have tried many brands of coffee and I always come back to Melitta.  This coffee is the best they have made....not too dark, not too light...simply perfect!"
204,B002TMV34E,1,1284249600,"I am a true coffee lover  and it is my favorite beverage morning or night.  I enjoy brewing coffee at home and buy a variety of brands in varying price points.  After reading the description of the Melitta Cafe Collection I was excited to brew it.  I was extremely disappointed by how stale the coffee smelled when I opened the bag and was not impressed by the flavor after I brewed it.  It tasted like a pouch of hotel coffee, no flavor, stale and bad aroma.  The packaging looks upscale and is a great price but unfortunately the coffee was not good, I had to throw it away."
205,B002TMV34E,5,1279152000,We enjoyed this coffee and would recommend it to others.  The coffee came pre-ground so there was no need for bean grinding.  I would say this is a medium blend coffee without any bitterness.  It would appeal to a variety of people as we certainly enjoyed it.
206,B002TMV34E,5,1279152000,"The key points here are probably the vacuum packing (no air!) and the extremely fine grind.  The fine grind results in a stronger cup off coffee with fewer grounds, meaning the bag lasts longer than a regular bag of coarsely ground beans.  I really can't say aenough about how finely ground it is: it's almost like a powder!  The vaccuum packing also means it's just a bit more fresh when you first open the bag.  Overall - no complaints at all: great tasting, strong-as-you-want-it coffee here."
207,B002TMV34E,1,1278806400,"Most high quality coffees have layers of flavor and nose you want to smell. I brewed this using my French press and was extremely disappointed.  This Melitta Classique Supreme is some of the worst, most bitter, awful-tasting coffee I have ever had.  There is no depth to it, it is not a ""good bitter"" like espresso, it is flat and harsh to the palate.<br /><br />Perhaps I am spoiled by having excellent local coffee producers, from which I purchase whole bean and grind them fresh before each brew. But I've actually had canned coffee from supermarkets that possessed more personality than this stuff."
208,B002TMV34E,2,1278633600,"Background:  I am a big fan of Trader Joe's coffee.  We have a Bunn Coffee Maker with the slow sprayhead and a Capresso Burr Grinder.  So, I guess you could say that my husband and I really like our coffee.  I usually use a combo of The Joe's coffee at TJ's and the decaf Columbian.  I do make it strong--I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.<br /><br />This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5-7 oz. cup.  I couldn't find the directions on the package as some people did--it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didn't like the flavor of the coffee.  It reminded me a lot of store bought Maxwell House or Diner coffee.  It had a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it for me.<br /><br />So, for me, I'm going to stick with Trader Joe's coffee."
209,B002TMV34E,4,1277942400,"Moderately flavorful with no trace of bitterness. Low acidity, nice aroma. I had to use significantly more per pot than the package specifies, but that is usually the case with my Cuisinart drip coffee maker."
210,B002TMV34E,5,1264896000,Recently tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique for the first time.  Unbelievable!  It's going to be hard to drink anything else in the future
211,B002TMV34E,5,1277596800,"Years ago, I used Melitta's coffee, and I'd forgotten how good it is.  When I tasted a cup of this blend, I was reminded how good it can be to drink a cup of coffee that has bold flavor, but NO bitterness.<br /><br />Unlike some ""designer"" brands that are so bitter they give you the shakes, or some supermarket brands that are weak and lacking aroma, Melitta has hearty, satisfying flavor, and a rich coffee smell. Brew it to your desired strength, sit back and enjoy!"
212,B002TMV34E,4,1277510400,"I've been a fan of the Melitta system for years. It's simple, and eliminates the expense of an<br />appliance. For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better ""gourmet"" coffees<br />out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents."
213,B002TMV34E,5,1277337600,"I am honestly, pleasantly surprised by Melitta's Classique Supreme blend.  I was expecting a grocery-store quality coffee, but it far surpasses anything I've purchased at my local supermarket and, interestingly enough, I like it better than most beans I've purchased at specialty coffee shops.  Here's why:<br /><br />It's got a bold flavor akin to Kenyan beans but has a rich, full, smooth (almost chocolatey) texture like Sumatra.  As if combining the best bits of my favorite coffee regions wasn't enough, it's a very low acidity coffee, almost completely lacking that bitter / burnt aftertaste that plagues so many dark blends.  It's not a ""bright"" coffee like those grown in Latin America.  I believe this blend of coffee would be absolutely PERFECT FOR DESSERT SERVICE, but shouldn't necessarily be limited there.<br /><br />I've brewed a few pots at work to rave reviews.  Even the barely-colored-water-that-she-calls-coffee gal shrugged and said it was good.  I'm not inclined to drink my coffee black, but this blend is smooth enough to be palatable, even for me.  In fact, I surprised myself by enjoying my first 10oz cup with no creams or sweetener.  Pretty remarkable stuff.<br /><br />At its current price point, it'll end up being a bit more expensive but of far better overall quality than your average grocery store, but may be comparable (or even cheaper) than your local coffee shop.  If you like a smooth, flavorful coffee, Melitta's Classique Supreme blend is a safe bet for a very enjoyable cup o' joe."
214,B002TMV34E,3,1282176000,"Before I start, I will openly admit that I love a good cup of coffee and over the years have become a bit of a coffee snob with my tastes.  I don't like any flavored coffees, iced coffees, or even much of the frilly expressos and cappaccinos.  I simply like a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />I liked the Melitta coffee okay but I'm truthfully not convinced it is worth its price.  Don't get me wrong, I consumed the whole bag; I am just unsure it is something I will purchase again.  It had the nice, strong taste of shade-grown coffee beans which I liked but I wouldn't say I loved.  I'm not sure it is any better than some of the specialties you can purchase in your local grocery (I'm not talking Folgers and Maxwell House here, but the other shade-grown coffees).<br /><br />If this product comes up in a good sale, I might be tempted to purchase it for a special occasion but otherwise, I probably won't be buying again."
215,B002TMV34E,4,1281657600,"I only purchased this because it was offered to me free through Vine. I usually buy Starbucks whole bean coffee and grind it myself. I was very surprised at how good this coffee was, even though it was already ground. It is strong and rich and fresh. I'd definitely buy this again!"
216,B002TMV34E,5,1278979200,"I use the Keurig Coffee maker at home.  It's great, I love it.  Read my review on it here within this site.  For those of you who don't know - the Keurig ""K-cup"" coffee maker uses these little cup-packets of coffee grounds to make individual servings of coffee.<br />~<br />I recently bought the part for my coffee maker that allows you to brew your own ground coffee, such as this. I've used it several times, but the coffee always comes out watery or bitter.  I was hesitant to try this brand but let me tell you - it's AWESOME.<br />~<br />This coffee is now my new favorite one to make at home. I've had it several times now and it's always consistently awesome.  A nice bold flavor without being bitter or watery.  It's the ultimate coffee - a nice solid smooth coffee flavor without any harshness or tart aftertaste.  I highly recommend this one for any Keurig Coffee Maker users out there!!!!"
217,B002TMV34E,5,1278633600,"Cold brew coffee is a tradition here in New Orleans and we are always looking for good coffee to use.  This Melitta Classique Supreme Ground produced a rich, delicious cold brew that we really enjoyed.  We will definitely order some more.<br /><br />If you've never tried cold brew coffee you really should.  This is the brewing system we use.  We've had it for over 20 years!  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW"">Toddy Cold Brew System</a>.  You have to let it sit all night and then you have to deal with a pound of wet grounds (we use them for fertilizer,) but when you're done you have a carafe of cold coffee that lasts (us anyway) about a week.  It's cold and refreshing and not the least bit bitter.<br /><br />Very nice an a hot summer morning."
218,B002TMV34E,5,1277596800,"I learned to drink coffee black and cheap and have never varied much from that.  Strong is fine so long as it isn't bitter.  Complexity is okay if you can find it cheap or if someone else is paying for the cup, but there's no need to get carried away.  It's just coffee.<br /><br />This Melitta brand (Cafe Collection Classique Supreme) is quite smooth and tasty.  If the cost was comparable to the big cans of Chock Full o'Nuts at BJ's I'd happily buy it.  But it just doesn't taste enough better for it to cost much more."
219,B002TMV34E,3,1277510400,"I like coffee a lot.  I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.<br /><br />My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I brewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks - two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used - I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and brands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used ""heaping"" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a ""medium"" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.<br /><br />If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.  You'll probably like this coffee from Melitta if Millstone is right up your alley."
220,B002TMV34E,4,1277337600,"Melitta does a good job with this medium-roast coffee.  If you need coffee for the office where you can't grind fresh, this is better than supermarket coffee (that often includes cheaper Robusta beans) by a long shot  Brew it a bit stronger than recommended to get a full taste.  You can't get it to taste like dark roast by making it stronger - that just makes coffee bitter.  If you want dark roast, buy dark roast.  Medium roast offers pleasures of its own, and can let the individual qualities of coffee come through nicely.<br /><br />Fine grind coffee is meant to made in a filter cone, and this stuff is pleasant and smooth with some personality when done that way.  So if you're looking for a  convenient ground medium-roast blend for weekday mornings and don't want to go through the hassle of picking out some fancy coffee and grinding it at the store, this is a good reliable solution.  Melitta has a good reputation for a reason.<br /><br />Oh, and it is Kosher, too."
221,B002TMV34E,3,1276905600,I like strong coffee; so when this came I made a pot and my husband and I tried it.  The coffee is ground fine and is bold in taste but not bitter.  Other than that I cannot say I would buy this coffee.  My husband liked it; I can take it or leave it.  Melitta has a good name and maybe if this coffee were brewed in a Melitta Coffee maker and filter; it might have a different flavor.  It was okay.
222,B002TMV34E,3,1279065600,"In marketing terms, I'm not certain what ""classique supreme"" is supposed to mean -- if anything. Reviewing coffee is a matter of taste, literally as well as figuratively, and I found this to be a fairly standard, but not at all bad, mid-range roast. On some tastings, it reminded me quite a bit of McDonalds coffee, which isn't necessarily a bad thing though it probably isn't either as ""classique"" or as ""supreme"" as the folks at Melitta would like. It was very drinkable across the course of a morning, neither aggressively dark and bitter nor bland and tasteless. Though I might venture out from time to time into other roasts and blends, this would be a perfectly serviceable day-to-day option for coffee fans."
223,B002TMV34E,5,1277251200,"I must admit that I had never tried any style of Melitta coffee before this Cafe Collection Classique Supreme.  I am an avid coffee drinker and have at leat 6 cups every morning.  It is just part of my regular routine.  I crave the cafeine and the taste just wakes me up and starts any day perfectly.  I always get a medium blend and find that with generic coffee be it Folgers, Maxwell House or any store brand I don't really notice a taste difference.<br /><br />So it was a treat to try a coffee that is considered  a delicacy and not just a power boost.  This coffee is a pleasure from just opening the bag.  The aroma of just the beans is beautiful.  And when you go to make the coffee you will probably do the same as me and go to measure the amount equal to the water amount the same as when you make your standard coffee.  But you may have to toy with the measurement of coffee per ounces of water to be able to fully appreciate this coffee.  It was nice to have this coffee that is part of a specialty collection meet up to my expectations.  The beans are ground extra fine and though still providing a medium blend quality it far surpasses my regular coffee.  It definitely is smoother and the taste is rich and full providing a very satisfying coffee experience.  I found myself slowing down and enjoying each sip with absolute pleasure.<br /><br />As I said I am not one to explore all the supposedly specialty roasts or flavored coffees but am very glad I came across this Melitta blend.  Very satisfying and will definitely become part of my coffee regime when a definite treat is needed."
224,B002TMV34E,3,1277251200,"I brewed this coffee with the recommended ratio of water to coffee:  6 oz. water & 2 teaspoons coffee.  It was very weak brewed this way; like coffee-flavored tea.  So I brewed another batch at 3 t coffee to 6 oz. water and it was better.  This is not a bad cup of coffee just not very complex & definitely a medium roast at best.  I brewed some 8 O'Clock Original roast for comparison (I thought that would be a good coffee to compare) & this coffee came in second to that.  This is not a very interesting cup of coffee; serviceable and good for people who don't like a strong brew.  I am not a black, tar coffee lover but I prefer more flavor.<br /><br />If you like a dark roast coffee like Starbucks, you will be underwhelmed.  But if you like Folgers or other grocery store brands, this is definitely a step above.  It is not bitter & it is good with a bit of cream.<br /><br />I brew coffee using the pour-over method, directly in to my stainless carafe.  This is my system:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLIL"">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EN8DMU"">Copco 2 Quart Thermal Capacity Brushed Stainless Steel Carafe</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A"">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY"">RSVP Maunual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a>"
225,B002TMV34E,4,1306368000,"This is a good coffee for people who don't like their brew all that strong.  A friend who likes the lighter roasts loved this brand, and went ahead and bought his own 3-pack.<br /><br />Personally, I need more flavor and body in my morning cuppa coffee.<br /><br />This grind did work well in DSY ""pods"" such as Keurig."
226,B002TMV34E,3,1300924800,"I like strong coffee.  I like starbucks.  I wanted to like this coffee, but found it not strong enough, even when I tried to double up on the brew strength.  Still, for a weaker tasting coffee, it was good."
227,B002TMV34E,3,1299542400,"I will admit to being a relatively picky drinker when it comes to coffee.  I don't make coffee very much at home and when I do, I tend to buy whole beans to grind at home from independent coffee shops and stores.  Because of this I will admit to having a biased opinion of ground vs. whole bean coffee.  My experience has always been that that the preground coffee is never quite as full flavored and generally doesn't taste as good as the coffee house experience.<br /><br />This experience carried through here.  The coffee was good, certainly better than what I've had at a lot of restaurants, but it wasn't great.  I could see this being a good everyday drinking coffee if you're looking for something middle of the road for a caffeine fix, but since I drink coffee at home more rarely and more as a treat, I think I'll continue to splurge on whole bean coffees."
228,B002TMV34E,5,1296604800,"My husband's officemates take turns providing coffee for the machine. He took this in for his turn (without telling them anything about it) and probably half the office commented how good it was and asked where he got it--and requested he bring that variety again. So it looks like this will be a regular purchase for us.<br /><br />Direct from hubby: A very smooth and robust tasting coffee. I prefer the stronger varieties and this one does not disappoint! The first pot I mixed as I normally do for a new coffee, wow intense! I then backed down to a normal mix and enjoyed the pot more. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone that is seeking the deep, robust taste of a European coffee."
229,B002TMV34E,5,1293062400,"This is by far, one of my favorite Melitta coffees of the Cafe` collection. It brews perfect every time. It's robust without being bitter. If you like a good cup of coffee this is a winner."
230,B002TMV34E,5,1292544000,"We are coffee lovers and creatures of habit. Trying something new in the coffee arena is always a chancy proposition. Still, I'm happy we gave this coffee a try.<br /><br />I brewed this coffee in our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VELUA"">Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker</a>. I used filtered water and seven slightly rounded tablespoons of coffee to a full 12-cup pot. This Melitta coffee came out strong, but not bitter. A pinch of cream later, and we had coffee that rivals some we've had in the best restaurants. This coffee has a full-bodied, strong flavor without the bitterness that accompanies other strong coffees. Now that we've enjoyed success with this flavor, we'll be more likely to try other Melitta specialty coffees."
231,B002TMV34E,4,1285027200,"I'm no coffee specialist, but I'm pretty demanding when it comes to the qualities that I like in my coffee.  Rich.  Nicely roasted and balanced.  Full flavored.  If you don't like any of those characteristics, then this review won't do much for you.  Anyway, I'm pretty tired of Starbucks.  It's overly roasted, almost to a burnt sensation, and drips a bit too much with bitterness.  I tolerate it because most of the other coffee vendors in the area sell watered down garbage.  A little while back, Melitta was offered on Vine and I figured, why not give it a try.  Boiling water, 4 minutes in a french press, and some milk and sugar, and I'm in business.  Surprisingly, it was a great cup of coffee.  Nice depth, a lovely balanced and almost creamy texture, great roast, and not exceedingly bitter or sludgy.  The real test now is for me to do a head to head against my current favorite go-to: Illy.  I have a feeling that Melitta may hold up pretty well."
232,B002TMV34E,4,1284595200,"No disappointments with this coffee. I have always been fond of Melitta coffee and this lived up to their great reputation, although a bit pricey."
233,B002TMV34E,3,1282780800,I enjoyed this coffee for it's smooth flavor that wasn't extremely strong. It's definitely better than most brands you find in the grocery store. I would recommend this to someone interested in a solid cup of coffee.
234,B002TMV34E,5,1282780800,"My wife is the coffee drinker in the family, a longtime fanatic of the bean.  These days she keeps a large can of Folger's French Roast Medium Dark in the fridge, and takes a foray into the more premium blends on a regular basis as a treat.  When I got the Melitta Classique Supreme for her as a trial, the yummy sounds could be heard throughout the house.  ""Even fuller, richer, and more robust,"" are her exact words.  Great stocking stuffer, at the least, and don't be surprised if it becomes your favorite."
235,B002TMV34E,4,1282176000,"This is a very good coffee, and I am one who loves his coffee. Why do I love this coffee? Well, I loved it so because it was strong, but not overly simplistic. It had hints of many different flavors, and they were blended together to form a symphony of taste. In fact, it was as strong as starbucks, but not pedestrian and simplistic. It also brewed very nicely in my Mr.Coffee brewer, as well as my camp percolator. Anyway, a great coffee."
236,B002TMV34E,3,1282089600,"I love good coffee but I hate a strong taste. This is perfect! It has an excellent smooth flavor and a wonderful aroma. Just writing this makes me crave a cup. Unfortunately the packaging is ridiculous and I won't deal with it again. It was impossible to open the bag by pulling the seal apart. I had to resort to cutting it open with scissors, which created sharp edges in the heavy foil. with better packaging, I would definitely rate this 5 stars."
237,B002TMV34E,5,1280275200,The aroma from this coffe when I opened the bag was amazing.  The coffee flavor was bold and yet not overpowering.  It was not bitter and had a nice crisp flavor. My husband also enjoyed it.  Would be curious to try the same coffee if it comes in decaf to see if it retains its flavor.<br />Would serve this to guests at a dinner party.
238,B002TMV34E,3,1279756800,This coffee was just so-so; nothing to write home about. I honestly couldn't distinguish it from one of the generic canister brands at the local grocery store.
239,B002TMV34E,4,1279756800,"I'm a casual coffee drinker who is more likely to like McDonalds or Duncan Donuts coffee than Starbucks, which I find too burnt. I also like sugar and milk so I'm not obsessing over subtleties of flavor. This coffee was noticably better than supermarket brands and, in my opinion, milder and superior to the fancy brands as well. It is a good quality coffee at a good price and, as a result, a good value. I'd recommend this and would consider this as an every-day brand."
240,B002TMV34E,5,1279670400,"I am a coffee lover and quite picky about my coffees. Every coffee brand claims hand-picked gourmet coffee, so it is hard to find a good bean. As with many things, coffee is a matter of personal taste. I don't like the bitter flavor of Starbucks, for example, which is the result of their trademark roast. I like flavorful coffe that is not bitter. I loved this coffee from Melitta.<br /><br />It is complex and rich, very european in flavor and not bitter at all. It is surely one of my personal favorites. At any given time I have 6 to 8 coffee varieties at home (both whole beans and ground), yet I find myself choosing this Melitta coffee every time and I am not getting tired of it. You should try it."
241,B002TMV34E,4,1279670400,"This is a ""non-offensive"" middle of the road coffee.  Most coffee drinkers will probably like it, but it's not exactly memorable either.  Better than the grocery store variety, not as good as the high end stuff.  Another reviewer commented that it reminds them of McDonald's coffee, I would agree with that.  McDonald's new coffee isn't bad at all so it's not a complaint."
242,B002TMV34E,4,1279584000,"In our home we prefer coffee that is smooth and not very strong. Dunkin Donuts is preferred to Starbucks. We like this coffee. Not love, but it is pretty good. We have served it to a dozen neighbors.  None commented on its taste, but when we asked they all said it was very good (these were all guys who would have no trouble complaining if they didn't like it). My brother, who prefers strong coffee, also said that he really liked it and that it was smooth.  So, with a dozen tasters reporting, all liked it, but nobody raved about it.  We would buy it again."
243,B002TMV34E,4,1279584000,"This coffee produced a dark and rich cup of coffee that tasted great.  I found this stuff to be ground a bit fine -- more along the lines of espresso than something I would put into my regular coffee maker, and way too fine for my press. I'd give it five stars except for the packaging: I've opened hundreds of bags of coffee in my time, but this is the first one that I pretty much destroyed.  The bag is sealed along each of the corners to make a seam at each edge and those seams don't like to come apart.  Unfortunately, the remaining opening was too small to get my tablespoon inside to get the coffee out, so I had to rip the sides out a bit."
244,B002TMV34E,3,1279411200,"This is good coffee, but nothing to write home about.  I like the grind, which is finer than most ground coffee, although I prefer grinding the beans myself.  It has a bold, but not bitter, taste.  Even though I'll stick to Eight O'Clock as my coffee of choice, this one certainly isn't objectionable and is better than most cups you'll get at the diner.  And it's certainly better than Folgers, MH, and other grocery store brands."
245,B002TMV34E,3,1279324800,"Since it's difficult to explain the taste to you in any realistic and helpful way (A salesperson would tell you different I'm sure). I will just say if it's better, worse, or similar to than some other coffees that I and maybe you have tried. For the most part I would say it tastes like Starbucks coffee. I am not a fan of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />* Dunkin Donuts Regular is better.<br />* Starbucks Regular is similar<br />* <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4F14"">Folgers Classic Roast Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a> is worse<br />* <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDKDM4"">Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag</a> is better<br />* <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0R4"">Melitta Classic Premium Blend Medium Roast Ground Coffee, 23-Ounce Cans (Pack of 2)</a> is better<br />* <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXMAWM"">New England Coffee 100% Colombian Supremo, Coffee, 11 oz</a> is better<br />* Whatever the heck they serve at my work is worse"
246,B002TMV34E,3,1279238400,"I acquired this coffee through the Vine program.  I found the coffee to be just ok, with nothing to either recommend it or to take away from it. The package lists the grind as extra fine, but it is really just barely a fine grind with several larger pieces in it than you would not normally find in a fine grind.  This is not really an issue unless you really needed a fine grind.  It works just fine in a drip coffee maker with a paper filter.<br /><br />As for flavor, the coffee is not bitter, but does not have much of a personality.  I would compare it to MJB or any other mass marketed coffee on the store shelves.  This would probably be a fine coffee to use if you were going to add your own flavorings as there is nothing to get in the way of the flavorings that you would be adding."
247,B002TMV34E,3,1279152000,"I was expecting a very high quality coffee but this wasn't quite it. It's a lot stronger than I was expecting due to the serving size printed on the label. It was pretty strong even for me and I like strong coffee.<br /><br />However, I adjusted the amount of coffee and after a couple of tries I got a nice pot. It has good, but not great flavor. Definitely better than Folgers and the like but not top tier quality.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking for something a step up from Folgers."
248,B002TMV34E,3,1279152000,"I drink coffee almost every day.  I sip and enjoy it rather than slamming back X number of cups required to get me through the day.  This is a nice pre-ground sipping coffee. It's not an aficionado's coffee, not so much because of flavor rather than that it comes pre-ground.  It kind of fits in a quirky in between niche.  Not for the Folgers crowd but not for the gourmand either.  All in all, not bad.  My biggest complaint was the packaging.  This was sealed so tightly that I pretty much had to destroy the bag to get it open.  I guess this may be symptomatic of premium pre-ground coffee because they are trying to keep in as much flavor as possible.  However, as an average consumer I find it annoying."
249,B002TMV34E,4,1279152000,This coffee hasa full - Robust flavor that is great alone or with a meal!
250,B002TMV34E,5,1279065600,"This is incredible smelling and tasting coffee. I'm fortunate to live in a city that's known for it's coffee, so I'm spoiled when it comes to being able to get a good cup of joe. This Melitta Cafe coffee is the best, pre-ground, home brewed coffee I've ever had, hands down. As cheesy as it sounds, I even had one of those television commercial moments when I first opened the bag: I said ""Ah!"" and inhaled the woody and nutty aroma deeply. I was instantly sold. The coffee is ground very fine, allowing all the flavor to end up in your cup and not in the trash, garden, or food bin. Even when watered down to make an iced drink the flavor stays prominent. This would be a great blend for homemade coffee ice cream or desserts that use non-instant coffee as an ingredient. I would and have recommended this brand to family and friends."
251,B002TMV34E,4,1279065600,"The Melitta Cafe Collection ""Classique Supreme"" coffee is good - make no mistake about that - it's good coffee.  It's a VERY FINE grind, so it comes out strong and exceptionally flavorful.  I use about 10% less of this than I do of other brands with a normal grind.<br /><br />It's a good price for a premium coffee, and the fine grind makes it even more economical - while still tasting like an excellent, premium coffee!"
252,B002TMV34E,4,1279065600,"This is first time I had ever tried or heard of Melitta coffee, though I had used some of their filters (which I like).  I drink coffee everyday (about 3 cups in the morning) and like ""between roast""--which is between medium and a dark coffee.  I also like coffee that is not bitter but has a strong kick to it.  I tested a medium roast from Melitta and found it to have a pleasant smooth flavor and was very nice to drink.  It was not bitter at all.  I tried it both black and with sugar and cream and enjoyed it both times.  I generally do not drink black coffee but this brand was pleasant when served black.  I usually drink Community Coffee (a local Louisiana brand) and enjoy that brand's strength. Melitta does not have a strong flavor or ""kick"" to it.  I very much enjoyed it and would consider buying it if my regular brand was not available."
253,B002TMV34E,5,1278979200,"If you want a rich, smooth tasting, strong, but not bitter cup of coffee, I highly recommend this product.  It is not as dark as I normally buy, but it stands up quite well using my espresso machine (an inexpensive non-pump).  I was surprised at the crema it produced.  In short, it's everything I look for in a delicious cup of coffee."
254,B002TMV34E,4,1278979200,"I usually use fresh ground beans so my expectations were low.  I was quite pleasantly surprised.  This is a rich, flavorful coffee blend, without tasting processed or bitter.  Best of all, it is the perfect grind for a Melitta pot and that makes a big difference."
255,B002TMV34E,5,1278892800,"I'm accustomed to grinding my own coffee beans and steeping them in a French press.  I've sort of become spoiled by the better flavor of having my morning brew done this way.<br /><br />When I received a bag of Melitta Cafe Collection, I was skeptical that I would get good enough flavor from a pre-ground coffee.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it does really well in a French press.  The flavor is very good, definitely better than other pre-ground coffees.  The grind is a bit finer than I usually do it for the French press, but it still works great.<br /><br />The French press is a good test of coffee flavor.  If coffee tastes good under this more demanding method, it should definitely do very well in a coffee machine.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pre-ground coffee with good flavor, this one is a good choice."
256,B002TMV34E,5,1278892800,"Okay, I'll admit it: I'm a coffee addict. Lately my hubby and I have been brewing Starbucks coffee, with varying success (I'm not a big fan of Breakfast Blend), so I looked forward to trying a new and different brand.  We've now drunk our way through most of a bag of the Melitta, and I am happy to report that our impressions are highly favorable. The most important thing to know about this coffee is that it is decidedly on the mild side; although the bag specified ""medium roast,"" it was much milder and smoother than I was used to tasting with a medium roast blend. But that's okay, as I much prefer a milder coffee to anything with bitter overtones, which I often find in other brands of coffee labeled medium or bold.<br /><br />To cap things off, the Melitta coffee is noticeably cheaper than Starbucks.  Hmmm.... I may just switch coffee loyalties."
257,B002TMV34E,3,1278892800,"I have become somewhat of a coffee snob over the years and consider it one of the few grocery items that I will pay top dollar for if it suits my taste. My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast, so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.<br /><br />While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma, it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best, a perfect cup, in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests, who thought it was just okay.<br /><br />So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay, but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind, which I like, but the bean is not very dark. The brewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend, give this a try."
258,B002TMV34E,5,1278806400,"If you're a coffee lover like me, then I suggest you try Melitta coffee.  This particular coffee is ground finely enough to be used in an espresso machine, but works just as well in a drip coffee maker.  I really like this coffee because I love the taste of strong, rich, and aromatic coffee, but I do not like when it is so strong and dark that it tastes bitter.  Melitta Cafe Collection Classique fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />My husband, who is also a coffee drinker, but doesn't quite appreciate it the way I do, only drinks coffee from a drip machine and has to make it very light and very sweet.  He is notorious for using the flavored coffee creamers.  When he he drank this coffee, prepared the same way he prepares his regular Folgers brand coffee, he didn't notice a difference and had no idea that I had let him try a new type of coffee.  So with that being said, if you're a regular supermarket brand coffee drinker who has to mask the flavor of coffee with sugar or flavored creamers, then I recommend not spending the extra money on this coffee as you probably won't notice a difference.  On the other hand, if you are like me, and truly appreciate coffee (I don't use sugar and use minimal creamer) then do yourself a favor and try it!"
259,B002TMV34E,3,1278720000,"Smooth rich coffee, comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions, I prefer with my coffee maker.<br />Often I find, when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee, I find it too strong.  This was no exception.<br />I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water, which would have been about 21-22 teaspoons. Slightly different, but harsher tasting.<br /><br />All in all a good cup of coffee."
260,B002TMV34E,4,1278720000,"I admit to being one of those annoying self-confessed coffee snobs who insists on using fresh beans which I grind daily myself, but I got the Melitta ground coffee to sample and I'm pleasantly surprised. It's smooth and tasty, definitely not too acidic or overpowering by any means. Of course, a lot of the time, coffee taste and flavor will depend on how you prepare it, but comparing it to my regular brews it was on a similar level, though I think I'll always stick to the freshness and enjoyment of grinding the beans myself every morning, and trying different varieties."
261,B002TMV34E,4,1278720000,"I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. I've tried most major brands of coffee, from the makers of specialty coffee such as Starbucks and Peets to makers of commercial-grade coffee such as Folgers, Maxwell House, and Yuban.<br /><br />I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. It definitely ranks as one of the best coffee I've ever tasted. It is medium-bodied yet rich, aromatic, and robust. I usually associate a darker gourmet coffee with flavor, but Melitta has changed that perception. It is not bitter and very smooth to the palate.<br /><br />I generally prefer a darker, more full-bodied coffee such as Peet's, so I was surprised that I enjoyed Melitta a fair bit. While it doesn't displace Peet's as my favorite coffee, it offers a very nice departure from a full-bodied coffee without compromising on flavor. Another plus for me is the Melitta packs quite a punch in caffeine!<br /><br />---<br />If you like a coffee with a lighter body, you will enjoy the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. If you're accustomed to a darker coffee, the Melitta may or may not be suited to your taste. (You won't know it until you try it!) The bottom line -- The Melitta is without question the best quality coffee I've ever had in this price range."
262,B002TMV34E,4,1278720000,"In deciding to review this coffee, I knew my opinion alone wasn't enough. While I found it to be a very smooth and non-bitter treat for my mornings, I decided to take the biggest risk of all and serve it to my coworkers.<br /><br />Cubicle inhabitants have been known to maim anyone responsible for a bad batch of coffee, and I was prepared to either smile pleasantly or use my chair as a battering ram while I ran for the exit.<br /><br />The first person who tried it had this to say;<br /><br />""...It has a smooth taste which allows the drinker to savor the flavor without the bitterness or unpleasant aftertaste found in higher priced coffees such as those offered by Starbucks.  The overall taste is reminiscent of a light to medium roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5MS4"">Seattle's Best</a>. The only drawback I can see to this coffee is that now my cup is empty.  Overall I think it is a good coffee, and a good roast.  While I normally prefer darker roasts I would recommend this coffee as a good choice.""<br /><br />What can I say, he's an English major who enjoys a fine cuppa Joe. I would still be pulling Swingline staples out of my backside if he didn't like it.<br /><br />Here's what another one said:<br /><br />""...On the initial taste, when hottest, one can mistake this for a light roast as there is no bitterness in the aftertaste usually associated with Medium to Dark Roasts.  On subsequent sipping the coffee's taste does linger well afterword with little to no bitterness; again much like a light roast, but with fuller flavor that one expects from more robust roasts.  This coffee has enough flavor to warrant very little sweetener and no cream at all which should make most coffee enthusiasts happy with this selection...Recommended.""<br /><br />This one works in tech support - I would be typing this review with one hand if he didn't enjoy this coffee.<br /><br />I even made sure to get an opinion from the usual tea drinker:<br /><br />""Right-o.  So, as a tea-drinking-my-coffee-must-have-creamer-so-I-don't-taste-the-coffee person, here are my impressions:<br />Smell: slightly bitter with an earthy tone<br />Sight: Rather dark, not pitch black, but dark enough for concern.<br />Taste (black): Dirt with a side of mud.  Very straight forward coffee, no messing about.<br />Taste (with creamer...lots of creamer): my tongue thanked me!<br /><br />Not my favorite as a drinking coffee, I prefer a lighter roast.  But, it would be a good baking coffee, particularly if you used it for a dark mocha torte or for mocha cookies.""<br /><br />So there you have it!<br /><br /> I should also add that I usually don't make the coffee in my office - ever since I served this, I have been asked ""Where's that coffee you brought in last week? Are you going to bring more?""<br /><br />If it's good enough for the cubicle crew, it's good enough for you. :-)"
263,B002TMV34E,5,1278633600,"Smooth full (almost nutty) flavor, never bitter, moderate roast.  Not too strong, but not wimpy either!  A really nice coffee that's a good compromise when families or office-mates have different tastes in coffee.<br /><br />I'm a heavy coffee drinker who has tried it all-- the cheap stuff and expensive brands.  I enjoyed this more than comparable Starbucks brand coffee.  Those who tend to prefer flavored coffees (hazelnut, cinnamon, other mild and rich flavors) will most likely find this a very pleasant unflavored alternative.<br /><br />Well packaged with the typical vacuum-pack and ""fat wire"" turn-down/close mechanism. Highly recommended."
264,B002TMV34E,5,1278633600,"Oh, yes! Great coffee.<br /><br />My daughter had been raving about Melitta so I wanted to try it. Would an only-sometimes coffee drinker like me think it worth the extra price? The answer is yes. I need but one assurance for that price, though. I'd like the package to tell me that it is organically grown and forest-friendly. Is it?"
265,B002TMV34E,3,1278547200,The coffee was ok. Not as strong as we normally like so I had to use a little more grounds but the flavor was ok then. The bag was one of those re-open bag but it would not open and when it finally did it tore a huge gash down the side. -1 star for each. Don't know if I will purchase again.
266,B002TMV34E,4,1278547200,"The coffee was mellow with a little bite to the finish. Compares favorably to most coffees out there with just a tad more harshness. I found the packaging ridiculously difficult to open - finally taking a scissors to it. The description says ""Pack of 3"" but I only received 1. Overall a good coffee."
267,B002TMV34E,4,1278547200,"I enjoyed this coffee! It's got a rather bold flavor and is a little sweeter than most coffees, but that's what made it a stand out for me. If you're looking to try something new, then give this flavorful and hearty blend a try!"
268,B002TMV34E,3,1278460800,"I may not do much well, but people have complemented me on my coffee for over 40 years. I like a strong, rich coffee but hate the acidy taste that some coffees have. I've been grinding fresh beans for about 25 years, instead of grinding them at the store or buying ground coffee. I think it makes the coffee taste a little fresher and with less acid.<br /><br />I served the Melitta Classique Supreme Ground Coffee to guests last Sunday and everyone really liked the rich taste and I didn't have to make it stronger; I measured it properly and got a really rich coffee. It is good but... I can taste a slight hint of acidy after taste that I don't get with my Starbucks beans.<br /><br />I'd say that, if you don't grind your coffee bean before brewing each pot, then this coffee is as good or better than most ground coffees. The convenience of having it delivered and sent by Amazon are real pluses."
269,B002TMV34E,4,1278460800,"I drink coffee quite often but I'm not really a connoisseur. I did, however, invite family and friends over (some of whom are avid coffee drinkers), and we devoured the 11oz bag of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee in about a week. I had a bit of trepidation over trying this coffee, since I had never purchased pre-ground coffee before, but after the first cup, my reservations vanished.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, we were dazzled by the rich scents that were released when we opened the bag for the first time. It was surprising then, that the resulting coffee didn't have that much aroma. Don't get me wrong - the coffee tasted great, but I wanted a richer experience.<br /><br />Overall, we concurred that it's better than most store brands like Costco's Kirkland Signature or lower-priced brands like San Francisco Bay, but Starbucks own beans or some of the beans available from Peets produced better coffee. In the end, Melitta provides a good value proposition that I can certainly live with."
270,B002TMV34E,5,1278374400,"Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee is a mid-priced coffee; it's not truly expensive, but it costs more than many coffee drinkers normally pay.  So the major question that arises is, is it worth it?<br /><br />And the answer all depends on what you want.  It's richer. more mellow, and far better tasting than the economy brands, but it's not as full bodied, nuanced, or enjoyable as the premium brands.<br /><br />It is neither Tiffany nor WalMart.<br /><br />But is is good.  And in my opinion (which surely is what taste truly is), it's worth the $$$.<br /><br />Five stars:  good value for the money."
271,B002TMV34E,5,1278374400,"Having lived in Europe for over 30 years, it was indeed a pleasure to savor a more classical, European style gourmet coffee. This was the first time that I had tried the Melitta brand and I was very pleased with the aroma during brewing, which did remind me of cafes back in Britain and France. You need to make a fairly generous brew to get the full-bodied impact from this blend and it goes very well with cream and also a dab of honey. The taste is quite rich and the aroma during brewing is very much like freshly ground coffee beans.<br /><br />I am sure that I will be back for more as it makes for a delightful brew that is great to wake up to on a Sunday morning, or any morning for that matter."
272,B002TMV34E,4,1278288000,"This coffee has a robust flavor with hints of chocolate undertones and a somewhat earthy nose. It's not bright or winey like Kenya or Columbian coffees, but it's also not as heavy as a Sumatra. Classique is called a medium blend, and it would be a good after-dinner coffee. I drank the coffee by itself, but it would have the body to stand up to a sweet dessert. The mouthfeel was a bit on the heavy side, but the coffee did not leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I think Classique is a little on the heavy side for a breakfast coffee, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. A 5-star coffee would be good to drink at any time."
273,B002TMV34E,4,1278288000,"When I first tried this coffee it had a dark, rich, overly strong flavor and color. In fact it was a bit bitter and was definately not a blend I would recommend. I decided to work with the amount used for each pot and ultimately ended up using less than recommended and it turned out to be very good. I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this brand but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong, rich blend this is the coffee for you. By using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong, rich, flavorful cup of very good coffee. The fine grind is a nice touch and gives one the feeling that all of the ground beans are being used. Definately a vast improvement over the usual store varieties. Give it a try and chance's are it will grow on you."
274,B002TMV34E,4,1278288000,"My wife is Austrian and her favorite coffee is the Julius Meinl coffee. We like this coffee so much that we order it from Vienna (in our opinion it rates 5 stars). In order to test how good this coffee is, I substituted the Julius Meinl coffee with the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme. My wife drank her coffee and did not say anything. When I told her about the substitution she was quite surprised and she asks about how expensive the Melitta is. Ordering coffee from Vienna is very expensive.<br /><br />In my opinion, this coffee is slightly (very subtle difference) inferior to the Julius Meinl which is our gold standard. Given that the Melitta is much cheaper we will be buying this coffee in the future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!"
275,B002TMV34E,4,1278115200,"The coffee, when made in accordance to the directions, is bold and flavorful.  If you like your coffee to taste like coffee - this is a good blend for you.  Best left unadulturated - so no creamer or sweetener.  The second batch we made, we made it a little weaker than the directions, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well.  It is a premium coffee, and priced that way - but if you appreciate a fine cup of joe this will fit the bill."
276,B002TMV34E,3,1278028800,"I took a try on this one through the Vine program.  For a starting poing, I consider Pike Place Roast from Starbucks to be a four star under this system with Jamaican Blue Mountain being the epitome of five star coffee.<br /><br />I tried the Classique at regular strength and thought it to be watery with a long lasting aftertaste - not a good combination.  At double strength, the taste approached a good cup of Folgers, but the aftertaste remained - slightly bitter and pervasive. I am sure there is a chemical explanation for that, but I don't have it... :)<br /><br />In conclusion, not a ""horrible"" tasting coffee... just on the southern side of ordinary - with a cloying aftertaste that kills the deal.  Not for me, and i would not recommend.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
277,B002TMV34E,5,1277942400,"I drink coffee everyday but I prefer home-brewed compared to those that you buy at the coffee shop. By doing so, you conform it more to your desired taste and strength and it is healthier, without the calorie packed extras you get from the regular coffee shop. Upon opening the package, the aroma is instantly enticing. You can tell right away just by the scent that it is gourmet coffee. Upon brewing, this is where it gets you salivating. The fine-ground Arabica variety of this coffee instantly gives you a strong craving from the Once you pour smell. it on the cup and have a sip, it gives a satisfying taste, bold and rich, trademarks of a true gourmet coffee."
278,B002TMV34E,4,1277942400,I'm a tea drinker now even though I used to drink lots of coffee.  Most coffee is too strong and bitter for my taste.  But I dragged out my little Mr. Coffee machine and was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  It smells nice and is ground pretty fine.  I'm incorporating it into my daily intake of caffeine now and will definitely finish the bag.
279,B002TMV34E,5,1277942400,I was really surprised about how good this coffee is.  I normally buy a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts bag at the grocery store but his is right up there in quality and the price is a little better.  The coffee itself is very fresh and has a strong black nutty flavor that I really like.  Enjoy:)
280,B002TMV34E,3,1277856000,"I'm not much of a coffee snob. Heck, I'll drink whatever dreck the greasy spoons are serving without complaining. At home, I'll even reheat a cup that's been sitting around all day, as horrid as that sounds. I totally eschew that dark, burnt-tasting, supposedly gourmet Starbucks (jokingly called Charbucks in our home) simply because it's far too strong for my tastes. But when it comes to my fresh cup of coffee in the morning - you know, the one that gets you going, the most important cup of coffee you'll drink all day - I like it to taste robust, hearty, sensual and strong.<br /><br />Coffee made in drip coffee makers always seems to lack this quality. Coffee from those popular machines always has a somewhat ""cardboardy"" flavor, in my opinion. So it was with some trepidation that I chose to receive Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique. When I actually do make drip coffee or perked coffee (for dinner guests and the like), I grind the beans fresh which helps both styles have that coffee shop flavor you can't seem to get any other way, unless you own an espresso machine or a french press, but I digress.<br /><br />Since this is already ground in the bag, I knew that my best bet would be to make it over-strong to help the situation out. I don't own a french press, an espresso maker or any other fancy coffee gadgetry. Instead, I made a single, large mug with 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds tucked in side a Melita coffee filter (stapled shut) and brewed for about 6 minutes on high in the microwave, much the same way I make coffee from Folger's coffee singles.  And it worked, the coffee smelled great, was a nice dark color and I looked forward to my first warm sip.<br /><br />And that's when I became disappointed. As dark as the color was, as rich as the aroma was, the flavor was...  lackluster. It simply didn't stand up to my cheap, easy Folgers singles. And that's a shame, because now I have almost an entire container of coffee to go through. And about that container...  It was almost impossible to open. The gold wire wrap that is supposed to keep the coffee closed later fell off immediately. It took a pair of scissors to open the bag and even then there was some trouble. Compared to simply tearing open a Folger's single, this put one more hassle in my morning that I didn't need.<br /><br />All in all, it was just OK coffee. For a premium roasted coffee brand, you'd think this would knock me out of my slippers but instead left me pining for something else. Coffee, anyone?"
281,B002TMV34E,4,1277683200,"My life could be a coffee commercial.  I have to be at work by 5AM every day.  I can't say this Melitta Classic coffee makes me want to get out of bed per usual, but it has definitely been a perk over the last couple of days.  I drink a lot of coffee every day--usually a black classic roast of some sort.  And I have no shame in admitting that when I brew at home it is usually a mid priced coffee purchased at the Supermarket.  Its only when I am out that I get to partake in a more premium brand.<br /><br />I was delighted to find that Melitta's Classique is a medium brew ground super fine producing a rich and savory cup of coffee.  The balance of flavor is delicious and lends well to creamers. The only disappointment I encountered was the packaging.  I was very careful and still managed to end up with a floor full of grounds while initially opening the package. It arrived fresh, and I will definitely be making a purchase again."
282,B002TMV34E,5,1277683200,"I typically purchase my favorite ""grocery store"" brands in whole bean form and grind them myself on my burr grinder.  My typical brands are Peet's House Blend or Newman's Organic in a medium roast, as well as the occasional bag of Starbucks or Green Mountain.  Thumbing through Amazon, I was intrigued by the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, and its extra fine grind, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised by the Melitta.  The coffee was darker and more opaque than normal, no doubt due to the finer grind.  The aroma was very rich and robust.  The taste is actually much better than I am used to - a rich, refined roast with a smooth mouthfeel.  I find it to be much better than Millstone and equivalents.<br /><br />After trying this coffee, I am placing an order for 3 more bags.  I definitely recommend trying a bag of this coffee!"
283,B002TMV34E,4,1277596800,"I probably had my first cup of Melitta back in college, considering it a more sophisticated option than Yuban. That's due to its branding (which has remained consistent for as long as I can remember) and its promise of a ""European"" experience which once you get to Europe, you realize is a pretty broad and meaningless term.<br /><br />But no matter. The coffee's good. It's for you if you like mainstream flavor blends and a medium roast but want to step up in quality. $6 for 11 ounces (one bag) is a fair price and it gets more affordable if you do the subscribe-and-save deal which comes with free shipping. The vacuum bag makes for a compact package when you're storing it before use and seals tight after you open it; the quality is a cut above from some other vacuum bags I've tried that leak coffee grounds, making a mess in the pantry.<br /><br />One odd thing, my three-pack came with just one bag coffee in a wasteful big cardboard shipper. I was getting it for review so can't complain, but this is not typical of Amazon."
284,B002TMV34E,5,1277510400,"I am not a coffee connoisseur by any means. I only know what I like and what my family likes to drink.  Gourmet coffees to me taste pretty much the same as a good ole can of generic coffee.  Until I tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee.  First off I noticed that the flavor was not too strong.  I am not a fan of coffee that tastes like sludge and lean towards the medium to light roasts most of the time.  Secondly, it smells great brewing.  I know I am having a good coffee day when I can smell it.  The taste is delicate but flavorful.  I tried it black, black with equal, and then black with equal and powdered creamer (my favorite flavoring) and each time, the coffee was enjoyable.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this coffee again.  It comes in a pack of three for only eighteen dollars which is comparable to other brands of coffee that taste ten times worse.  The only negative thing I can say is that the bag is 11-ounces and not a full pound.<br /><br />In fact, I think I'll got make a pot now!<br /><br />Natalie S."
285,B002TMV34E,4,1277510400,"When first unwrapping the 11 oz. Package of Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, the aroma may bring about the anticipation of what to expect from this brand.  And after preparing two or more teaspoons, depending on one's preference, and hearing the coffee maker percolate and finally smelling the freshly made pot of coffee made and taking the first sip, one will experience Melitta as an alternative to other gourmet coffees.  With its mild and not as strong taste as a regular cup of Starbuck's, coffee drinkers familiar with Folgers' Gourmet Selections may find this brand as comparable.  Indeed, a coffee worth trying."
286,B002TMV34E,5,1277510400,"Delicious!  Because of the fine grind, I thought the coffee might be a little bitter, but it's not.  It's delicious and smooth.  My favorite coffee is Caribou, but this is not far behind.  I followed the instructions exactly, using two teaspoons per 6oz of water.  I have a coffee maker where you put the beans in one side, and the water in the other, and press a button. . .  so measuring ground coffee is not my thing, but this worked great.  I didn't have a problem using it in my non-Melitta coffee maker at all.  Very enjoyable.  .. rich flavor. . . smooth. . . What's not to like? ;-)"
287,B002TMV34E,4,1277424000,"Does have the claimed European flavor -- seemingly between French and Italian.  Better than Folgers, but not as good as premium brands.  A bit weak.  I needed to use more coffee than I usually do to get a strong enough brew.  Not bad, but I'll pass and go with a premium brand."
288,B002TMV34E,3,1277424000,"I don't drink a lot of coffee, but when I do I prefer it black. If a coffee requires sugar and milk to taste good, it's not for me. I expected anything from Melitta to be a quality coffee, and I was not disappointed, but neither was I delighted.<br /><br />The good:<br />* Fills the room with a welcoming aroma, one of the better-smelling coffees I have had<br />* Taste is not too bitter, even when made a bit on the strong side (if Starbucks is too strong for you, you will like this)<br />* Package is vacuum-sealed for freshness<br />* Better than your average grocery store coffee<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />* Not the best coffee I've had by far. I would put it below Seattle's Best and some of the coffees I get some a local organic store.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good coffee and we will definitely use it up without complaint. I replaced our normal office coffee with this and everyone enjoyed it, but they would not necessarily want to pay a premium over the bulk coffee they normally use."
289,B002TMV34E,4,1277337600,"This is a very nice, ""European""-type coffee. It has a very smooth flavor, almost akin to that of chocolate. The quality is high,and it is packed in a Vacu-Pack bag, very good for the preservation of freshness in this high-end coffee. Recommended."
290,B002TMV34E,3,1277337600,"There's not much to review here. It's good coffee. It has a slight after-taste of flowers or sweetness, but it's otherwise an interesting medium blend of coffee. The package is a little hard to open (requires scissors), but the coffee itself tastes pretty decent.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a medium roast. `Well worth the money."
291,B002TMV34E,4,1277337600,"My wife is an accountant so we go through a lot of coffee. And she likes her coffee strong. Her favorite, and mine, are the ""Colombian"" roast coffees. Colombian coffee is not really the roast, its the source. Only coffee from Colombia can be called Colombian and for whatever reason, Colombian coffee from just about everyone is a medium-dark body, hearty coffee. And that is pretty much exactly what this coffee tastes like, the store brand of Colombian coffee from Kroger or Pubix, which btw also tastes close to 8 O'Clock Colombian blend. If you prefer Colombian blends of coffee, at this point, since taste is not really an issue, price should be the only deciding factor. That is pretty much the deciding factor for us since all of these Colombian labeled coffees taste almost the same."
292,B002TMV34E,3,1277337600,"I love a good cup of coffee & the scent of it is one of the best parts, from how it smells before brewing to the final product. So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta brand of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average brands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I brew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).<br /><br />The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I brewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.<br /><br />The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full-time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part-time job) or the Dunkin-Donuts brand coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods."
293,B002TMV34E,4,1277251200,"Strong and good, that's what my wife said about me - no she didn't. I made this coffee exactly like I make my daily Yuban, 8 cups and 4 teaspoons of coffee. When I tasted it the first thing I noticed was the flavor was considerably stronger than what I'm used to. Nevertheless it tasted very good and in all honesty it is better than Yuban but costs more too. Some people might not agree because they would prefer a milder blend. I suggest giving it a try and make up your own mind."
294,B002TMV34E,4,1277251200,"I'm a big coffee drinker so I'm quite picky about the brands and roasts I buy. This Melitta coffee is a medium roast, very smooth and not bitter. The grind is very fine so I was expecting it to be strong or espresso-like, but it turned out to be a nicely balanced medium blend. I prefer this type of coffee to the brands that are overly strong and have a burnt taste. Just make sure to follow the instructions on the bag for the amount of coffee per water. You can adjust more or less coffee based on your preferences. If you're making it as iced, use a little extra coffee. I'm glad I found this brand for a nice everyday coffee."
295,B002TMV34E,3,1277251200,"Good coffee. I guess I expected it to be very strong, ""European"", but it was pleasant. (Of course I didn't make it strong, either). The Vine package was 11-ounces, so the ""pack of 3"" is not understood by me. Again, good coffee, but I didn't find it to be especially ""outstanding"". My favorite coffee is still the ""Eight-O-Clock"" brand, and it costs a lot less."
296,B002TMV34E,5,1277251200,"Classique Supreme is the second of the Melitta Gourmet Coffee Cafe Collection coffees I've tried. (I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My coffee of choice to date, which I've been drinking for around 2 decades, is Peet's (which I get shipped to me as there are no Peet's outlets near me). Peet's sells several varieties which I like, and I always buy whole beans and grind them to make a cup at a time via a cone filter. When making coffee for 2 or 3 people I make each cup separately (using 2 or 3 cone filters at once). Also, I never drink straight coffee but always sweeten it (usually with honey) and add half & half (and sometimes French Vanilla International Delight).<br /><br />Melitta's Classique Supreme, as well as the Hazelnut Creme Brulee in the same line (and I assume all the varieties in their Cafe Collection line) are ground ""Extra Fine,"" and look to me to be finely ground enough to be used in an espresso maker (though I only make espresso - which I use in homemade lattes - with unflavored dark roasted coffees and the Classique Supreme is a medium roast). It looks and feels too finely ground to be used in a French Press (which I occasionally use for preparing coffee made from freshly ground beans, ground relatively coarse).<br /><br />So for testing/sampling purposes, I've been preparing the Classique Supreme (which I've drank several cups of over a couple of days) in a filter cone, using the exact measurements I use when preparing ground Peet's beans. And once I have sweetened and creamed the coffee to my taste, I cannot detect a difference in quality. The only difference I have noticed is that both varieties of Melitta's Cafe Collection that I've sampled leave me with less of an intense caffeine buzz than I typically get from the same size cup of Peet's (whether it's a medium or dark roast variety of Peet's). That's not necessarily a bad thing, for sometimes my second cup of coffee of the day (I usually drink 2 TALL cups a day) leaves me feeling a bit over-caffeinated (e.g., headachey or just off-kilter).<br /><br />The bottom line is that I like this coffee and given the relatively low price (e.g., at Amazon as well as Melitta's website), I'm motivated to try other varieties in Melitta's Cafe Collection line (particularly their darker roasts).<br /><br />I had difficulty opening both 11 oz. sample bags of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee I received - I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag - so I called Melitta to comment about this. The customer service representative I spoke with said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top of the bag.<br /><br />*(The phrase ""cup of joe"" supposedly came into vogue after Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, Josephus Daniels, banned alcohol aboard navy vessels in 1914, leaving coffee the strongest drink on navy ships.)"
297,B002TMV34E,3,1277251200,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV34E"">Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Gourmet Coffee</a> is good coffee. However, Personally, I feel labeling ""gourmet"" is misleading<br /><br />When I think Gourmet Coffee, I think of something that's gonna taste a lot better than MJB (I prefer to call it Mary J Blige), Maxwell House, Foldgers, Yuban, Millstone, ETC<br /><br />It smells like expensive gourmet coffee, but it doesn't taste gourmet<br /><br />And while this taste good, it really doesn't taste all that different than my usual cup of Maxwell house or MJB. So Paying 18 bucks (Current price) for 33 ounces (3 11 ounce bags) is a bit pricey for some fancy packaged plain-tasting coffee."
298,B002TMV34E,4,1277164800,"I'd say that naming this coffee blend ""Classique"" is appropriate. I found it a good, solid, ""classic"" coffee; neither too dark nor too light, bold without being bitter, and without any excessive non-coffee notes to the flavor. You know, the sort of ""notes"" or ""tones"" that often get bragged about in descriptions of coffees, such as ""floral"", ""citrus"", ""nutty"", ""winy"", etc. Perhaps more delicate palates than mine will detect some of those notes, but my point is that they don't stand out excessively. This is a nice, unpretentious coffee that tastes like coffee."
299,B002TMV34E,1,1279152000,My husband and I tried this coffee in place of our favorite Dunkin Donuts one day and we had to throw out the pot. It was too bitter to drink! We definitely do not recommend this coffee.
300,B002TMV34E,2,1277596800,"We enjoy our morning coffee and, years ago, bought an espresso machine to stop paying so much money over to Starbucks.  Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.<br /><br />Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.<br /><br />The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Used grounds can be used in the garden<br />Not bitter or acidic<br /><br />CONS:<br />Bland & forgetful flavor"

307,B000I1RHMU,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
308,B000I1RHMU,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
309,B000I1RHMU,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
310,B000I1RHMU,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."

312,B000I1RHMU,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."

I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
315,B000I1RHMU,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
316,B000I1RHMU,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
317,B000I1RHMU,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
318,B000I1RHMU,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
319,B000I1RHMU,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
320,B000I1RHMU,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
321,B000I1RHMU,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
322,B000I1RHMU,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
323,B000I1RHMU,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
324,B000I1RHMU,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
325,B000I1RHMU,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
326,B000I1RHMU,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
327,B000I1RHMU,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
328,B000I1RHMU,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.

330,B000I1RHMU,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.

333,B000I1RHMU,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.

336,B000I1RHMU,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
337,B000I1RHMU,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
338,B000I1RHMU,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
339,B000I1RHMU,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
340,B000I1RHMU,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
341,B000I1RHMU,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
342,B000I1RHMU,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
343,B000I1RHMU,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
344,B000I1RHMU,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
345,B000I1RHMU,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
346,B000I1RHMU,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
347,B000I1RHMU,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
348,B000I1RHMU,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
349,B000I1RHMU,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
350,B000I1RHMU,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
351,B000I1RHMU,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
352,B000I1RHMU,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
353,B000I1RHMU,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
354,B000I1RHMU,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
355,B000I1RHMU,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
356,B000I1RHMU,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
357,B000I1RHMU,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
358,B000I1RHMU,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
359,B000I1RHMU,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
360,B000I1RHMU,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
361,B000I1RHMU,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
362,B000I1RHMU,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
363,B000I1RHMU,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
364,B000I1RHMU,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
365,B000I1RHMU,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
366,B000I1RHMU,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
367,B000I1RHMU,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
368,B000I1RHMU,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
369,B000I1RHMU,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
370,B000I1RHMU,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
371,B000I1RHMU,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
372,B000I1RHMU,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
373,B000I1RHMU,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
374,B000I1RHMU,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
375,B000I1RHMU,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
376,B000I1RHMU,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
377,B000I1RHMU,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
378,B000I1RHMU,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
379,B000I1RHMU,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
380,B000I1RHMU,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
381,B000I1RHMU,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
382,B000I1RHMU,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
383,B000I1RHMU,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
384,B000I1RHMU,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
385,B000I1RHMU,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
386,B000I1RHMU,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
387,B000I1RHMU,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
388,B000I1RHMU,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
389,B000I1RHMU,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
390,B000I1RHMU,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
391,B000I1RHMU,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
392,B000I1RHMU,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
393,B000I1RHMU,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
394,B000I1RHMU,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
395,B000I1RHMU,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
396,B000I1RHMU,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
397,B000I1RHMU,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
398,B000I1RHMU,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
399,B000I1RHMU,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
400,B000I1RHMU,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
401,B000I1RHMU,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
402,B007RTR89S,4,1338422400,"I ordered this for review (provided by company) and thought it's shampoo, it's not a miracle.<br /><br />It's not a miracle product but it out performed my regular shampoo and I would say it worked as well as the product I bought at the saloon.<br /><br />It smells nice--not overwhelming.<br />It suds well in hard water.<br />My hair isn't heavy or greasy.<br /><br />I'll purchase more when I run out of it."
403,B007RTR89S,2,1338249600,"I've used this product several times now and it's leaving a weird texture in my hair. You don't need very much, and it's got a nice creamy consistency, but when you use it and dry your hair it's like a film is left behind. I didn't feel like this was a good product."
404,B007RTR89S,5,1337904000,"This shampoo lathers up really well, rinses easily, and left my hair feeling nice, shiny and clean.  My hair is curly and has sometimes frizzes in humid weather, but so far, all okay.<br /><br />My hair is colored treated so I will update review after several washings, but so far, I like what I see and feel.<br /><br />>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br />As of today (May 28) still using this product and it keeps my color bright, my hair is not frizzy and I would recommend this shampoo."
405,B007RTR89S,4,1337904000,"I have highlighted hair but I don't consider it damaged.  I've tried this shampoo for 3 days and I like it.  The fragrance is wonderful.  The shampoo has a similar texture and slip to Matrix Sleek shampoo, which I like to use during warm, humid weather for de-frizzing.  I didn't notice any unnecessary weight on my hair, which sometimes happens with shampoos that claim to be for damaged hair.  I would buy this shampoo."
406,B007RTR89S,4,1337817600,"I think this shampoo is really good. I like the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling. I spend a lot of time outside and have my hair colored often and I don't always use conditioner with this brand of shampoo. I sometimes put some on the ends, but that's been about it. Now if Amazon could just get the packing down...."
407,B007RTR89S,5,1337817600,"Shampoos are tricky for my hair.  It's a bit more coarse, and has a bit of a curl to it, but after using this shampoo for a short time I've found that my hair has more shine and is easier to style than with my previous shampoo which I paid more for.<br /><br />I do color my hair, but I can't really comment on how well it protects against fading since my color was a bit faded prior to using this shampoo, but if the product lives up to this claim like it does the others than I am sure it will do an admiral job.<br /><br />For the price I LOVE this shampoo.  I love the way it smells (not to fruity or flowery, just a nice scent) I love that my scalp is less irritated, and I like my hair more while using it (something that is hard to do).  My only wish was that it was sulfate free, but at this price I think I will be switching to this shampoo from now on!"
408,B007RTR89S,5,1337817600,"If you have color treated your hair and/or your scalp needs more moisture, then this shampoo is for you.  Your hair will feel fresher, shinier and will have more slide and glide when you style it.  It is very gentle and does not leave your hair feeling rough or traumatized when you wash it.  The product lives up to its claim of nourishing your scalp as it is power packed with vitamins and other natural products.  It also has a very pleasant aroma."
409,B007RTR89S,5,1343606400,Ok this stuff does magic i have been struggling for a hair product that would help my nasty hair and i have finally found it!! And for people that are to lazy to go to a drug store and purchase this so they can have a full bottle come on really why would you purchase this from the internet really people!! I got mine personally at wal mart and didn't have any accidents with it!! the smell is great i don't understand peoples opinion that is to strong of a smell me personally i love when i greet people with huggs n they complimant the smell on my hair :) grow up people!! Nothing in life is perfect!!
410,B007RTR89S,5,1344124800,"I am really impressed with the new line of shampoos and conditioners from Clear Scalp.  This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and wonderfully soft.  It doesn't weigh my hair down or increase the number of tangles. It has a pleasant faint apple scent and you don't need to use very much to get a nice lather.  I have tried many different shampoos, including expensive salon brands, on my color treated long fine hair, and this is one of the best ones I have tried.  Combined with the Damage & Color Repair conditioner, this left my hair feeling soft and healthy.  I really recommend this shampoo for anyone with color treated hair."
411,B007RTR89S,1,1340150400,"I like my regular shampoo better.  I didn't see anything special this shampoo did, no glowing or silkiness.  I guess it is just okay.  I wouldn't buy it.  Soybean product in shampoo?  I don't like the idea of soybeans in my shampoo.  Maybe that's why the hair didn't glow or was silky.  This shampoo might be good for some, but not for me.  Oh, it's usable if you don't have anything else, but I wouldn't buy it.  It could have gotten 3 stars, but the soybeans brought it down to one."
412,B007RTR89S,1,1338854400,"I tried this shampoo (paired with the strength conditioner) for about a week and I had to get rid of it.  Here is why:<br />1. It is meant to make your scalp healthy, yet it gave me an itchy, flaky scalp.<br />2. The smell is so fake perfumy.  It smells like really cheap shampoo.<br />3. I thought perhaps it would be a more environmentally/animal-friendly version of their company (Unilever) kindof like how L'Oreal has the line Everpure, and sadly, it isn't.  According to the website (clearhair.com) It uses stearic acid (from cows) and it doesn't have a no-animal testing policy.  It is hard to call the product ""Clear"" when it has so many icky ingredients.<br /><br />Big thumbs down."
413,B007RTR89S,3,1338422400,"This is a good shampoo with a pleasant, apple-y scent. I don't think a shampoo that claims to be for ""color repair"" should contain sodium laureth sulfate -- I'd rather have less lather and have my color last longer. That said, the lather is generous, and the shampoo left my hair feeling clean and not stripped of moisture.<br /><br />I ordered three shampoo/conditioner products from Amazon, and all three leaked during shipping. They were wrapped in plastic, so it wasn't a huge mess, but it would be nice if Amazon could find a way to ship shampoo without it leaking.<br /><br />I don't think this shampoo is anything special, and probably not worth paying extra for."
414,B007RTR89S,2,1338249600,"I cannot review how well this shampoo works on the hair as it arrived in the mail with all of the shampoo leaked into the mailing envelope. I will say that if you are sensitive to products with strong fragrances like I am, this is not a good choice. It is heavily scented. I also don't recommend ordering this product through the mail as the pop top popped open and there was not packaging or shrink wrap to secure it shut."
415,B007RTR89S,2,1338681600,"I love the scent of this product. That's the good news. The only good news.<br /><br />But in my old age, I have developed a horrible itchy reaction to certain hair products, namely WEN, which gave me an awful rash on my hairline (front and back) as well as my entire neck. So when I saw this product, I thought it would be a relief now that my itchy WEN rash is finally (after SIX months of healing) a thing of the past.<br /><br />Sad to say that I was wrong. I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty conditioner and shampoo  three times in a row and guess what happened?  Yup. Same sort of irritation and itching in all of the same places.<br /><br />There must be a very specific ingredient the makers of hair products are including in their respective cleansers and conditioners because the fact that this has happened AGAIN literally has me scratching my head in disbelief.<br /><br />Again, this shampoo (and its companion conditioner) has a lovely scent - but I will not spend my waking and sleeping hours scratching myself like a cat with fleas.  If you have any sensitivity to hair products, avoid this one.<br /><br />Boo. So goes this product the way of WEN. In the trash."
416,B007RTR89S,2,1344038400,"After finally caving into the commercials and all the rave reviews I finally caved in and bought this shampoo and conditioner, the one labeled Damage and Color Repair, it's been a month now and I just finished the bottles and I'm not at all impressed, in fact I'm disappointed and almost angry. I have fine dry hair that I color once a month, now this shampoo, wow, it strips the color right out of my hair because of all the sulfates in it. I've NEVER seen a shampoo do this to my hair before. Because of this my color faded terribly and I had to recolor my hair. The shampoo also dried my already dry hair out even MORE and caused more shedding.<br />Problem two, the conditioner, I felt like I couldn't rinse it out, I didn't use a lot, maybe a tiny little dime sized and still when I dried my hair it felt like there was still a weird sticky film in my hair that weighed my hair down, leaving my hair with no life, no shine, nothing.<br />2 stars for it being pleasant smelling and having a good bottle design."
417,B007RTR89S,1,1344038400,"My review below is very detailed, but if you are having issues with your hair because of this shampoo your FIRST step is to get it out of your hair.  Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo, follow with a moisturizing conditioner, and then use Apple Cider Vinegar or another vinegar to strip this shampoo and reminents out of your hair.  THEN do a hot oil treatment.  After the hot oil treatment wash and condition again and your hair should stop shedding.<br />=============================<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />I don't know if this shampoo is damaging my hair, but I noticed that I can just touch my hair after using this shampoo and it sheds. My hair sheds a lot anyway so I definitely would not use a shampoo that causes it to shed even more. The shampoo smells good and is creamy.<br /><br />From reading the other reviews, apparently YOU HAVE TO USE the conditioner or you will mess up your hair.  I would NEVER use a shampoo that strips the hair just so you can use a special conditioner to re-soften it.<br /><br />UPdate: I am downgrading to a ONE (1*).  I have NEVER had a bald spot in my life.  It has been 3 weeks now and my hair feels like straw (in spite of several deep conditionings at home and the salon).  Today, I look in the mirror and I now have a bald spot (IN THE FRONT OF MY HEAD) from all the breakage and shedding.  It is CLEAR this shampoo has a protein in it which is a NO-NO for damaged hair UNLESS you use a certain type of conditioner to bring back the softness.<br /><br />Once I discovered the bald spot, I began to panic and I went and bought the CLEAR conditioner trying to get the dryness to leave and it still didn't leave.  I am sitting here now with my regular conditioner trying to get the softness back.  I am afraid it will not come back and I will have to wait for my hair to grow out.  This shampoo is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Update #2: This is all I had to do to stop my hair from falling out.  I had to do a clarifier.  First, I used a mixture of baking soda and water.  This soften the hair immediately, but the shedding didn't stop so I slept in a plastic cap with an oil [I used mustard oil, but any oil likely will do]).  I woke up this morning and the hair was definitely in better condition.  I then went to my refrigerator and used Apple Cidar Vinegar, more oil, and my Creme of Nature Shampoo and Conditioner.  The hair is FINALLY back to its original condition (except for the bald spot)."
418,B007RTR89S,4,1340150400,"Fragrance: EXTREMELY strong, synthetic smelling fragrance.  I used the product once to give a fair review and the scent made me ill.  If you aren't sensitive to strong and/or synthetic scents it's probably going to just smell like shampoo to you.<br /><br />Cleaning:  Cleaned hair very well, lathered richly, rinsed easily.<br /><br />Conditioning:  I normally use a conditioner but did not need to after using this shampoo.  Huge bonus points for that.<br /><br />Safe for color treated hair:  The product contains sodium laureth sulfate which is considered to be easier on colored hair than many of the other sulfates.  In an ideal world there would be an affordable, sulfate-free, effective shampoo--but we don't live in that world--yet.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a good product but I will continue my search for a color safe shampoo that has no sulfates and actually cleans your hair and leaves it in a somewhat manageable condition."
419,B007RTR89S,4,1338681600,"I have dyed my hair for years and am always trying different shampoos. My hair is straight and on the fine side and I wash it every day. I liked this shampoo. It lathers well (even in our hard water) and left my hair feeling nice. I didn't need any conditioner and it didn't dry out my hair or weigh it down.<br /><br />I think it has a strong scent - not totally unpleasant, but if you're sensitive to scents, it may bother you.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon didn't ship this in a padded envelope. Somehow the shampoo bottle opened and while the bottle was wrapped in plastic, I lost about 1/3 of the shampoo. Shipping this in a box would have prevented this problem."
420,B007RTR89S,3,1348185600,"I purchased this shampoo about 2 weeks ago, and used it for the first time last weekend.  After using it in the shower, I noticed that my forehead and temples were blotchy red, clearly an allergic reaction.  I put cortisone on the blotches and took two benadryl tablets and the blotches subsided after a few hours.  In order to determine whether or not it was indeed this shampoo that caused the reaction (and not some other product or a random food allergy), I used the shampoo in the shower again this morning.  While I was rinsing it, my face and neck began to itch, and when I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror, the blotchiness had returned.<br /><br />I don't usually have particularly sensitive skin, but do have various allergies in my immediate family - two brothers are allergic to latex, one of my sons is peanut-allergic, and another son is allergic to cats and dogs.  I checked the label of the product, and noticed that it contained almond oil and soy, which is not a problem for me, but might be a problem for someone allergic to those foods (yes, I know you don't EAT the shampoo, but sometimes people with food allergies react to it when it comes into contact with their skin).<br /><br />I called the 800 number on the bottle to report the allergic reaction, and they were very nice about it - a representative took my info, and another person called me back a few hours later.  They asked me to return the unused product and they are going to send me a refund and coupons for alternate products.<br /><br />I am giving this product 3 stars based on the fact that my hair looked clean after use, and the customer service people were pleasant.  Obviously I'm not going to purchase it again though."
421,B007RTR89S,5,1346803200,"First of all, this review is for the shampoo only (the colored/damaged hair version). I purchased this because I read an article in a magazine that said that normal shampoos/shampooing doesn't clear the hair follicles of dead skin cells and sebum, clogging them and making it more challenging for hair to grown long and strong. I have long, naturally curly blonde hair that I color dark brown and straighten daily. It is about 6 inches past my clavicle, and I have been trying to grow it past my breasts, ala Kim Kardashian, for what seems like years. I had beautiful long hair as a teen, but since being in my adult years, just can't seem to get past this length where it ends right around my underarms.<br />I have been using this shampoo for a little over a week (probably around 10 days) and can honestly say I am VERY impressed. I am someone who has always believed that shampoo doesn't really matter in comparison to a good, rich conditioner. Well, I was wrong. I massage this shampoo into my roots in a circular motion with my fingertips, being sure to reach all of my scalps, and taking around 2-3 minutes to do my whole head before rinsing. I am using my usual conditioner (Tresseme Soft and Silky), which I always use. My hair feels incredibly soft and shiny, and actually appears to be stronger as I don't have as many stray hairs all over my bathroom after styling. My root area has more volume than usual and my hair just feels cleaner overall than normal.<br />The next test is to see if it starts to accelerate in growth, which will probably not be visible for a little while. Meanwhile, I am going to switch to the Clear conditioner too once my Treseme is gone. This will be the first shampoo that I ever re-purchase out of loyalty. As for the scent, it is fine...not too floral or strong. It really just has that typical ""clean shampoo"" smell. My boyfriend likes it, which is great because he only seems to like very clean scents. However, if you are particularly sensitive to heavy scents, you may want to steer clear of this as it is definitely perfumed.<br />Another nice thing I noted is that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is listed fairly towards the end of the ingredient list, unlike most shampoos that list it right after water (like the V05 I usually use).<br />Overall, I am happy with this product and will continue to use it. I am also going to monitor my hair growth to see if this will help my healing my scalp.<br />**update**<br />I finished my bottle today, roughly 30 days after I wrote this review and noticed that my hair does seem longer by about an inch. Obviously I cant be 100% sure since I didn't measure it before starting to use this shampoo, but if I noticed it that alone is a big deal as my hair grows very slowly. I will definitely re-purchase!"
422,B007RTR89S,3,1343520000,"The first time I used the shampoo, my hair felt like it was made out of straw. It literally stripped my hair of all moisture. Reading the bottle, it requires the conditioner to make it a complete package. At first I didn't want to try the two because I was worried it would make my hair worse, but finally I gave in and selected the conditioner as well. I'm very happy that I did! Using the shampoo and conditioner exclusively, I have to say my hair is definitely shinier, softer and healthier than before. I love the pleasing scent of the shampoo and conditioner. Neither are overwhelming. I don't know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out, but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing. I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results. I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products."
423,B007RTR89S,3,1343520000,"I ordered this to alternate with the Clear Ultra Shea shampoo, which, for a sulfate containing shampoo, I actually like. This Damage and Color Repair version has a very strong frangrance in comparison with the Ultra Shea, and for an alleged restorative shampoo, seems pretty drying to my color treated hair. This requires extra time with a conditioner, which is not the case with the Ultra Shea. The product was not a home run for me, and I will likely not purchase it in the future."
424,B007RTR89S,3,1342656000,"I received this item free for review.  I've got shoulder-length curly, frizzy hair.  Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The shampoo itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.  However, my hair doesn't look and feel nearly as good and the color is being stripped out of it with each washing.  I think I'm going to have to stop using it.  I've downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3."
425,B007RTR89S,5,1342483200,"Ironically, my scalp was dry and flakey...no clue why...just as the advertisements for this product started to appear.  Huh...well, decided give it a shot...other dry scalp shampoos, don't have companion conditioners and quite frankly are good tools if you want to remove hair coloring from your hair!  Nothing strips it like dandruff shampoos!  But this not only in two shampoos, relieved my itchy dry scalp, it left my hair nice...and has been much gentler on my OTC hair color.  I like the scent.  With the shampoo...a little goes a long way.  Nice rich suds that rinse easily.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner.  Will continue to do so."
426,B007RTR89S,3,1341792000,"The Good Stuff:<br /><br />The container is nice, dispenses well. The color is pale lavender. Whatever.<br /><br />The product itself is very creamy and light and has a whitish color before you apply it to your hair. It then lathers very well, especially in soft water. I had a 2-day dirty head so this worked very well on my hair and cleansed it without stripping it or making it feel dry.<br /><br />I dried and styled my hair like always yet it was more manageable than normal and did not have any frizz or ""stick out"" hairs. I liked that part.<br /><br />Here's the Bad Stuff:<br /><br />Woah, that is some flowery, perfume-y, strong scent! I rinsed my hair extremely well (hoping most of that scent would leave) and it still smelled VERY strong, after towel and blow drying it. This might be OK for some ladies, but this particular guy does not appreciate smelling like he just wallowed in the perfume display at Nordstrom.<br /><br />As well, there seems to be a slight residue after a few hours, especially the next morning. (And I had to throw my pillowcase in the laundry, it smelled just as strong.)<br /><br />All in all, not a bad product for your hair per se, but it's one that consumers should probably not buy unless they love smelling like a giant room freshening wick.<br /><br />+4 stars for what it did to my hair, -1 star for what it did to my nose."
427,B007RTR89S,3,1341705600,"""Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo"" is an average shampoo packaged in a 5-star container.  The shampoo is lightly scented; the fragrance is very pleasant.  A tablespoon of the shampoo does a nice job of cleaning one's hair.<br /><br />However, while ""Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo"" is labeled as specifically formulated for hair that has been ""color refreshed,"" it strips the color from hair much more than other similar products.  The suds, following shampooing, are very tinted by my semi-permanent hair color.  If I shampoo daily as is my custom, I foresee this shampoo ""stripping"" the color and revealing the grays in two weeks or less.  As I only recolor every four weeks, this is not acceptable.<br /><br />""Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo"" is packaged in a uniquely shaped container.  It fits nicely in one's hand; is easy to hold, even with wet hands; and is easy to control with respect to dispensing the shampoo.  I plan on saving the container and refilling when the ""Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo"" is gone.<br /><br />""Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo"" is an average shampoo in a 5-star container.  If you recolor more frequently than I do or use permanent color, you will find the product performs adequately.  Overall, it rates only 3 stars."
428,B007RTR89S,5,1341532800,"So a little background. My hair started turning gray early and I have to color it every 6 weeks. All that color has changed my scalp and hair texture. My scalp is now oily. I don't wash it for 3 or 4 days and I look like I put cooking oil in it. But the ends feel like straw. I went and bought Shampoo and Conditioner from a salon and figured I would need to buy the expensive stuff from now on. I saw this and was instantly interested because it talked about healing the scalp where all the problems come from. After using almost a whole bottle of this I feel like I can give it a thorough review. I have discovered you don't need as much, it covers and lathers well with a quarter size.I love the smell! Very light sweet and refreshing. My hair is not as oily as before and I don't have the straw feeling in the ends when I use the conditioner too. I am impressed and that is not an easy thing to do when it comes to hair care."
429,B007RTR89S,3,1341100800,"but nothing to jump up and down about.  As the other reviewers stated, it smells very nicely.  Interestingly enough, the scent does not fade in my hair.  At different times, when I swished my head, I caught whiffs of it.  It would not be a problem but it competed with my cologne in a horrible way.<br /><br />It cleans as promised but as someone who colors their hair, sulfates in a shampoo are not good and will wash your color out after a few washings.<br /><br />I gave it to my niece who doesn't color her hair and likes fruity scents."
430,B007RTR89S,1,1340668800,"I typically purchase Aveeno shampoo and conditioner, but saw a commercial for Clear and decided to give it a try. What a horrible mistake!  I used the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage and Color repair Shampoo and Conditioner together. I have shoulder length, thin, straight hair which I color every few months and blow dry every day.  The damage and color repair seemed like the best fit for me.<br /><br />The smell during use was okay, but it leaves a terrible chemical cloud around my head all day and even left the same smell on my pillow. This is not a fragrance it left-- it's chemicals.  My scalp started burning not long after use and it left my hair dry, dull, and frizzy.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last time I used such a terrible beauty product and cannot wait to wash this out of my hair!<br /><br />*The only redeeming quality of this product was the bottle design.  I do really like the way it opens and closes."
431,B007RTR89S,5,1340496000,I hd ordered the men's dandruff shampoo in this same brand.  It worked super well so I decided to try this one for my thin ageing hair.  When I use conditioner it just plasters my hair down because it's so thin.  This shampoo works great.  My hair is clean but not stripped.  No conditioner is needed.  Shiney and straight it has never looked better.  I highly recommend this shampoo.
432,B007RTR89S,2,1338508800,"I like having 3-4 different shampoo and conditioners on the go,  so when I was offered this on Amazon vine,  even though I didn't know the brand,  I thought,  what the hey,  and ordered it.  I received a shampoo and conditioner that were the same brand but not identical titles. One thing I didn't like straight away was that it wasn't blatantly clear which was the shampoo and which was the conditioner,  I like to know without squinting at the bottles.<br /><br />I used the shampoo and my hair felt heavy and dull and greasy.  It was a weirdly humid day so I thought I would give it another chance,  and this time used it without the same brand conditioner,  but it still gave me limp hair,  and certainly  my hair was not shinier or did the color come out more...  It actually made my hair look sad and I won't use it again."
433,B007RTR89S,4,1338508800,"I decided to try this shampoo as I regularly hi-light my hair.  To start, I'm a little skeptical over any shampoo that claims to be for damaged or color treated hair but isn't sulfate-free.  Regardless.... I like my shampoo to lather and I have found that when I actually use sulfate-free shampoo I don't notice any difference in the life of my hi-lights, and I end up wasting it because I keep trying to get it to lather by putting more and more in my hair (to no avail).<br /><br />Regarding this shampoo - I liked it and I'll buy it again.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell - it's not too strong as others have noted.  And once you rinse it out, it's about the same as any other shampoo.  I almost wish it had a stronger smell as I enjoy the smell of clean/fresh hair.  It didn't do anything mind-blowing-ly awesome to my hair, but it was nice.  A rich lather, a pleasant smell, and I will note - blow drying my hair was fast and less frizzy than normal.  I've noticed with the use of some other shampoos claiming to be for damaged hair, it takes me longer to blow dry my hair, which in turn, causes it to get frizzier.  Not with this shampoo - blow drying was fast, and for the most part, my hair has remained pretty flat all day (and I live in South Florida - so I know a thing or two about humidity).<br /><br />Overall, a good product that I would use again and recommend.  I can't give it 5 stars, simply for the fact that it claims to be for color-treated/damaged hair, yet contains sulfates."
434,B007RTR89S,4,1338422400,"I ordered this product because my hair is extremely damaged from hair coloring, and have been looking for a shampoo for color treated hair that didn't have a conditioner in it. My hair is extremely fine and thin, and conditioner weighs it down horribly. I also assumed that a new shampoo for color treated hair would be sulfate free, since sulfates are supposed to strip color from treated hair. The name 'Clear' carries connotations of purity to my mind.<br /><br />Sadly, the shampoo is not sulfate free- it's the second item on the list. So while it might be making my hair feel and look better temporarily, it's not going to help the color stay in. Which means more color damage as I have to frequently recolor... Also, the shampoo contains silicons. Now, silicons are much, much better for thin hair than oils are, but it's still a conditioner that can weigh thin, fine hair down.<br /><br />I've been using the shampoo daily for just over a week now. I can say that my hair is shinier after washing and drying, and a little easier to comb tangles out of. But the silicon does weigh my hair down a bit - not nearly as much as other shampoos for color treated hair do! - and I've noticed it collecting dust. I use a white comb, so I can readily see if there is dirt in my hair at the end of the day. Of course, I work in a very dusty/dirty atmosphere a lot of days, so YMMV.<br /><br />My decision in the end? This is a decent shampoo, and will probably use it a couple of times a week. But I want something without any conditioner/silicon for the rest of the time. Someone who has thicker hair will probably love this shampoo! I had my husband try it (his hair isn't damaged, or as limp as mine) and he thought it was really nice.<br /><br />Just one thing- I was a little confused when something named 'Clear' came out of the bottle as a creamy, opaque liquid. I rechecked the bottle to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten conditioner!"
435,B007RTR89S,5,1338249600,"I have long hair that is fine in texture and lots of it. I have my hair foil-wrapped (highlighted) about every 6-7 weeks or so. I live in a rural area and have somewhat hard well water.<br /><br />I don't really have any problems with my scalp like dandruff but because I have sort of hard well water, sometimes when I use certain moisturizing shampoos, due to all the ""gunk"" in them, they'll cause my scalp to itch and very occasionally will cause bumps like they are ""plugging up"" my folicles or something. In addition, after a few uses, some moisturizing shampoos leave my hair limp and lifeless.<br /><br />I can usually tell within a couple of uses or so whether or not the shampoo is going to work for me. I'm happy to say this shampoo works for me. After a few uses, my scalp felt fine - no itching or bumps - and my hair was soft without being weighed down.<br /><br />Also, I love the bottle this shampoo comes in. You might not be able to tell my the picture but rather than being a round bottle, it's quite oval shaped and to dispense the shampoo, you press down on one end of the top and it clicks down raising up the opposite edge that has the hole in it where the shampoo will come out.<br /><br />The oval shape makes this bottle much easier to keep ahold of than some of the bigger round bottles. One of the times I was using this shampoo, I didn't get quite enough shampoo to totally cover my hair and had to dispense more and even though my hands were soapy, I was able to grab the bottle with one hand, click it open, turn it upside down and dispense more shampoo into the palm of my opposite hand and then close the bottle up again and replace it on my shower shelf. All of that one handed and with soapy hands and I didn't drop it and it never felt like it was too slippery to keep ahold of.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is a creamy light pink color and fairly thick. Make sure your hair is extremely wet when applying so you can disperse it more easily through your hair.<br /><br />The only downside to this shampoo is the scent. To me it was a cross between ever-so-slightly chemically and sort of like the smell in the vitamin aisle of a healthfood store. It's wasn't absolutely hideous but just not my favorite and thankfully it dissipated quite a bit after my hair was dried and styled.<br /><br />I give this 4.75 stars. I like this enough that I would buy more in the future.<br /><br />Sincere THANKS to Amazon and the manufacturer/distributor who gave me the opportunity to give this product a try."
436,B007RTR89S,4,1351036800,"I loved (LOVED!) the Clear conditioner and had very high hopes for the shampoo. Perhaps too high. Because while I'm happy to report that it left my hair and scalp feeling fresh and clean -- which is, after all, what a shampoo is supposed to do -- it didn't leave my hair exponentially softer, the way Clear conditioner did."
437,B007RTR89S,4,1350518400,"I gave this to a woman in my life who is a lifelong salon shampoo and conditioner user and she said she really noticed a difference in the texture of her hair afterwords. The split ends were helped considerably. Being an older woman who has had her her colored many many times this was a shampoo that was surprisingly helpful despite its price. What was most noticeable to me was that her hair seemed to have more sheen than before using the product. Now I myself can't say I've used it, but for a woman that's had many hair treatments she has a pretty good estimation of how well these types of products work. I'd recommend at least sampling if you have damage from color treatments."
438,B007RTR89S,5,1348358400,"I got this item to see if it works even better with the Clear conditioner. I couldn't tell that much difference, but I really like both products and they make my hair very soft with a good smell. Again, I have curly hair which I color so when I find a new product that works well, it's a good day! I just wish all the hair products weren't so expensive. I recommend this product because if it works well on my hair, chances are it will on yours."
439,B007RTR89S,4,1346976000,"Well this shampoo is great.  First, it smells really nice without being overly perfumed.  Second, it lathers very well in my very thick hair.  Third, it cleans my very oily hair without overdrying.  Lastly, it leaves my hair looking very silky.  I have noticed a slight improvement in my dermatitis so that is an added benefit.  I got this bottle for free but I will buy one when it runs out.  And lest you wonder why I knocked off a star...it is because I am not a big fan of the spout and shape of the bottle.  It is a little akward to open and squeeze."
440,B007RTR89S,3,1345680000,"This shampoo does the job. It lathers well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine. After lathering, the shampoo rinses out well and my hair feels squeaky clean. You don't have to use much shampoo...a little goes a long way. I really can't find any superlative things to say about it, it does the job without any problems. I will say that I have an issue with telling which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner because the bottles are almost identical and I always forget which is which.<br /><br />I can't really tell if there is a benefit to using this on my colored hair or not. Everything seems fine with this shampoo, nothing stands out as being wonderful or awful. I did not have any leakage like other reviewers have reported with the shipping of this product. The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product."
441,B007RTR89S,4,1345593600,"There is a bit of a problem with these shampoo bottles that only really applies for shipping; the new pop top. I actually like the way the bottle opens during use - it's a vast improvement over smaller flip tops that are difficult to open with wet hands or those horrid little spout type bottles. Unfortunately, they don't ship well and arrived as a big mess. Fortunately, Amazon wrapped these in plastic which contained most of the mess but still about 1/4 of the bottle was gone.<br /><br />Now, aside from that, I'm not a big fan of the fragrance which seems quite strong...however, my better half loves the smell of this entire line of products. As for the function, with summer in Florida and very long hair, I have sun damage especially near the ends and this does seem to help keep the friz and breakage down. Hair is smooth although perhaps just a bit heavier feeling than I'd normally like.<br /><br />All in all, a nice product but open pop tops - despite the convenience when in use - leave something to be desired during extended shipping."
442,B007RTR89S,4,1345334400,"This product left my hair soft and shiny without being too limp or greasy looking. It has a really nice smell to it as well. It also helps with dandruff, so if you have hard water, then this would be a great product for your hair. I like this product, I would definitely buy it. I would next like to try the matching conditioner."
443,B007RTR89S,4,1344556800,This shampoo has a nice scent and leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth.I didn't find the scent to be too strong at all. The price is comparable to other brands so I will probable buy this again (although I don't recommend buying through the mail).
444,B007RTR89S,3,1344211200,"I love the CLEAR Conditioner and even though I received a bottle of it for review, I'll keep buying it.  The difference in my hair is amazing and though I complained that I'm getting weird little tangles at my hairline, it dawned on me that that's because the product is so good.  Duh!<br /><br />So, since I'd used the CLEAR conditioner with my regular shampoo and getting fabulous results, I was expecting great things from the CLEAR shampoo.  Alas, I've been using for about a month now and have come to the reluctant conclusion that it's merely average.  It smells wonderful and gets my hair clean, but it's not making any more difference in my hair than just using the conditioner.<br /><br />If you like your grooming products in matched sets, then by all means purchase away, but there's really no need.  It's possible to get the CLEAR results from the conditioner alone."
445,B007RTR89S,2,1344211200,"The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo smells absolutely incredible!  That's what makes it 2 stars and not lower.  I have used this shampoo about 5 or 6 times and even tried different conditioners with it.  However, each time, I had trouble combing the conditioner through my hair.  Also, my scalp itched slightly after using it.  I've used one of Clear's conditioners before, and it didn't get me an itchy scalp, so there must be a different ingredient in this shampoo that my body does not like.  Once again, the smell of the shampoo is absolutely incredible -- very clean, fresh, and great; but it doesn't make up for the tangly hair and bothered scalp."
446,B007RTR89S,3,1343779200,"Let me share the positive first.<br />This is a fine shampoo. I can't say I saw anything very special about it's shampooing ability, all the promised scalp and hair benefit, but I saw no negatives either. Just does a nice job<br />I think it has a pleasant smell, not too strong in my opinion.<br />And it has a nice consistency, although the lavender color is a little strange and unnecessary.<br /><br />But back to that container.<br />In use it is nice, wide, easy to use tilt top.<br />But once again (I reviewed a different variety of this brand before) the bottle leaked in transit.<br />Certainly a problem if you plan to buy it online. This time the top was wrapped in plastic, but it still came partially open and leaked. I guess the same factors that make it easy to use in a wet shower make it too easy to open in an Amazon box in shipping."
447,B007RTR89S,5,1343779200,"Okay, so I'll be the first to admit that I'm not super picky about the kind of Shampoo I use. I've been using K-PAK by Joico, but was running low. So when I saw this in the vine program I ordered it. I like the scent, and it doesn't seem to dry out my hair or scalp, so all's good."
448,B007RTR89S,4,1343520000,"This shampoo lathers thick and rich.  A relatively small amount made a huge amount of lather.  It's quite creamy, and it left my hair feeling quite nice and soft, not stripped.  My hair is long and thick, with a tendency towards dry ends.  This shampoo worked very well on it, and it smells fine.  The scent is not very strong, and not offensive.  The scent is not amazing, but certainly satisfactory."
449,B007RTR89S,4,1343260800,"nice shampoo. does a nice job in repairing and nourishing the hair.  I found it very easy on my hair. Lathered well, and rinsed out well--leaving no residual on my hair. Nice smell as well."
450,B007RTR89S,4,1343260800,"I was unsure what to make of this new hair care line.  All of the basic ingredients are the same as my other shampoos for color-treated hair.  Also, my understanding of basic health science regarding healthy hair & scalp left me skeptical that the Clear shampoo or conditioner would be much different than any other.<br /><br />Many people rely on hair care products to give them healthy hair, but forget that the food you eat and the shampooing technique used are far more important.  To properly shampoo hair, use the pads of your fingers, stimulate the scalp in rows of circular motions, for at least 30 seconds.  This increases nutrient-rich bloodflow to the scalp to encourage healthy hair growth, as well as adequately exfoliate the scalp.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Despite my initial misgivings that this line was all hype, I still gave both the shampoo and conditioner a try.<br /><br />The shampoo lathered up better than the other shampoo I had been using, so I ended up needing less of it.<br /><br />It rinsed away smoothly, leaving my hair feeling strong.  My other shampoo left my hair feeling a bit rough and tangled, and I had always thought this was just how colored hair felt.<br /><br />I see sunflower, soybean, almond & coconut oils, as well as aloe vera, further down on the Clear ingredient list.  While my other shampoo contains some fruit extracts and grape seed oil, it does not contain the soothing ingredients found in the Clear product.  I do think this must be part of the difference between the two that I've experienced.<br /><br />I don't have fragrance sensitivities, but I don't like when it is overwhelming.  I found the fragrance to be pleasant, to me it smells like apples.<br /><br />The lid design presses open with a lever-like motion, which is much easier to operate with wet hands than a flip-open cap.<br /><br />The assymetrical design of the bottle is interesting to look at, but is a huge pain when the wider part is put away facing down (such as when the contents are running low).  I use an over-the-shower-head wire rack for my products, and the awkward shape of this lid kept getting stuck under and around other bottles when I would try to pull it out, pulling other products out with it.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Keep in mind that shampoo is more for the scalp area of the hair, while conditioner is for the ends.  This works well for this product line's image when it comes to the shampoos, but not for the conditioners.  I also tried the Damage & Color Repair Conditioner, and the directions instruct the user to massage it into the scalp.  This is awful, resulting in greasy hair.  So be warned, if you use the conditioner as well, just use it like regular conditioner, combed through the ends of your hair, and keep it away from your scalp.  When used this way, it is nice conditioner.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Overall, I was pleased with the results of using the Clear shampoo and conditioner.  My hair looks nice, seems less stressed, more shiny, and styles well."
451,B007RTR89S,3,1343001600,"Since I color my hair, fading between treatments can become an issue, especially in the summer when I'm outside more often. I was excited about trying this product because I hoped it would slow the fading process. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. It could be that I'm looking for a miracle since probably the only thing that would keep hair well conditioned and glossy is to stick with one's natural color. On the plus side, the shampoo is pretty, pink, creamy, and scented (like strawberries)."
452,B007RTR89S,3,1342569600,"The Clear Scalp Damage & Color Repair shampoo is a reasonably good product: it has helped to minimize split ends during use. However, after spending a small fortune on coloring, I'm loathe to use this product: it contains sodium laureth sulfate, which can fade color more rapidly than shampoos without it.<br /><br />The fragrance is almost like a citrus, but a bit too cloying for my preference. The scent doesn't really linger after washing, though, which is good.<br /><br />The major drawback is actually a functional design. The bottle's closure and cap doesn't avoid inadvertent opening and leaking. The product arrived, having opened during shipment, and had spilled all over the inside of the shipping box. This meant a loss of about 1/4-1/3 of the shampoo; had there been other items in the box, they would've been destroyed. A similar issue was encountered when packing it in luggage for a trip."
453,B007RTR89S,3,1342569600,"Perhaps I have really odd hair texture, but unlike others who have reviewed here, my hair didn't feel clean after using the shampoo. I have very fine, straight as a board hair, that has been colored with a semi-permanent color to hide the grey. It can get dry, but not overly so. I liked the smell of the shampoo., and it lathered up nicely. But after I rinsed, my hair felt greasy, as if I hadn't used shampoo at all. My scalp also felt itchy afterward. Unfortunately I think I'm going to have to keep looking for a shampoo that works for me."
454,B007RTR89S,5,1342483200,"My hair is dry and damaged from years of coloring and blow-drying, and this shampoo makes it feel soft and silky. And it smells so great, and leaves my hair smelling good for hours afterwards. I love it!!!"
455,B007RTR89S,5,1342310400,"I had seen the commercial for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy.  I was intrigued by the idea of a shampoo and conditioner working from the scalp and its claim to restore the scalp's natural moisture balance.  I had never seen a product focused on the nourishing of the scalp which makes more sense than all the shampoos and conditioners of the past that are supposed to work on the ends of your hair.  The past products focused more on the prevention of split ends or ending fizzy hair.  I color my hair every 6 to 8 weeks, so I always purchase a color-safe shampoo and conditioner.  I also liked that has vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils and aloe vera.<br /><br />The bottles arrived wrapped in plastic bubble wrap and did have a small amount of leakage on the shampoo bottle but the conditioner bottle was okay.  I have used both the shampoo and conditioner for over a week and I like the products very much.  The shampoo has a lovely lavender color and a light scent.  I didn't find the scent overpowering.  I like that it takes a dime size amount to get a good lather.  The conditioner also works well with a small amount in your palm.  Most conditioners I use require quite a bit to work through my entire head of hair.  I think the conditioner is very easy to work through my hair without a lot of pulling and snagging.  It feels good and it doesn't leave a heavy, greasy film on my hair.  It rinses very clean.  Overall, I like the products.  Often in the past, most store bought shampoos begin to break my head and scalp out and neither of these products have done that.  I like that both shampoo and conditioner are designed to be set in such a way that the conditioner and shampoo bottles can be set flat so that the product is always draining down towards the opening.  I would recommend both of these products."
456,B007RTR89S,4,1342137600,"I found this shampoo good for every-day use. It's gentle but cleans thoroughly. I tried it with its companion product, Clear Scalp Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner (how's that for a long name?) and found they work well together. The shampoo is a little less effective at adding body than some other shampoos, and overall I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. But I have very fine, curly hair that's temperamental, so another person might not have the same experience. All in all, I'd say this product is worth a try."
457,B007RTR89S,5,1342051200,"Many times , I'm skeptical , I'm mean it's shampoo. How revolutionary can it be ? WRONG ! I truly felt a difference after finishing the bottle (which really lasted a long time). I don't use hair coloring , but years of styling products (mostly gel) have damaged my hair.<br />Clear scalp and hair beauty was a refreshing addition to my morning ritual."
458,B007RTR89S,4,1341964800,"I'm getting up there in years so my hair is turning into that wiry gray state.  I've started coloring which after the first few days out of the salon has turned me into porcupine head.  I've never thought much of shampoos & have usually just grabbed what's on sale.  Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy has turned me into a believer.  Just the smallest dab on the palm works into a frothy treatment.  I love the aroma (but remember, just a dab).  My hair is soft and cooperative for the first time in years.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers have mentioned, the top loosened during shipping and some leakage did occur.  All in all, though, I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend."
459,B007RTR89S,4,1341878400,"My hair is short, regularly coloured and I use shampoo and conditioners specificly for coloured hair.<br />The first time I used this I didn't use a conditioner and towel dried my hair, to be able to see the effectiveness of this product.<br />Works up into good lather (we have very hard water) and rinses quickly.<br />After being towelled dry, my hair felt clean with no residue and with a light lift in volume.<br />This was impressive given the heat and humidity of Texas in the summer.<br />Smells nice, very light scent but use a small amount as a little goes a long way.<br />A clean light fragrance after dry, feels clean and light with no residue, a good product."
460,B007RTR89S,4,1341619200,"I used both the shampoo and matching conditioner, they made my hair feel clean and soft. I had no problem combing through it and there was no residue feeling left on my hair after I rinsed it out. It also smells great. I will definitely buy this product again in the future. Try them both, they work well together."
461,B007RTR89S,4,1341187200,"The bottle for this shampoo has an opening that you lever up when you want to put shampoo on your hair.  The problem is that it also levers up easily during shipping, meaning the bottle is covered with shampoo when it arrives.  Amazon did wrap the bottle in a plastic bag to limit the damage, but the manufacturer should really design a bottle that doesn't leak, or at least seal the top with plastic tape.<br /><br />Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy has a strong, lingering fruity scent. Whether you like it will be a matter of taste. I color my hair, and I was hoping that a ""damage and color repair"" shampoo would do a good job of preserving color. I can't speak to the damage repair part, but it's not a very good color preserving shampoo. I would recommend it for someone with average, uncolored hair."
462,B007RTR89S,4,1341014400,"I was curious to try this after seeing a commercial about it. I am pleased with it overall - I have thick, wavy, hair down to the middle of my back with a fair amount gray up around my face. The smell is very pleasant, and my hair doesn't feel stripped after I've used it. I also don't have to use as much as I would with many shampoos. I don't wash my hair every day (more like every 3-4), so it's hard to tell about any improvement in breakage, but I do think there is a little bit. Overall, especially combined with the conditioner, I like it."
463,B007RTR89S,4,1340841600,"I have color treated hair and after several weeks using this shampoo I can say that it doesn't fade my hair color. I like the creamy consistency (rather than clear liquid) without leaving a greasy residue. Hair feels clean and light after washing without being too dry or dull. It also suds up well and I end up using much less than I normally do with a similar Pantene product. The drawback is that I don't detect any added benefit from the nutrium 10. I've used other salon quality shampoo that gives me thicker, more supple hair. This one doesn't - so only 4 stars."
464,B007RTR89S,5,1340755200,"I am really picky about my shampoos/conditioners, and was SO dubious when Amazon sent me this item to review.<br />I have colored, fine hair, which frizzes easily and breaks often.  It grows very slowly and any harsh shampoos/conditioners will either break my hair or weigh it down and make it look dirty and lifeless.<br /><br />Amazon sent me this item (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo) and the corresponding shampoo (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner).<br /><br />I usually use the Nexxus damaged hair products that are found at Costco.  It is expensive, even at Costco.  But it didn't weigh my hair down nor cause breakage.<br /><br />This shampoo and conditioner smells GREAT.  I usually don't notice the scents, unless they are gross or medicinal, because my sense of smell is limited.  But this one smells really great, like fruity flowers.<br /><br />I use it basically like everyone--shampoo, rinse, condition, let sit for a minute and rinse.<br /><br />Here is where it's different:  When I comb out my hair, which is longer than shoulder length, it doesn't pull, tangle, or (on the other end of the spectrum) feel greasy or heavy.  It combs out sleekly (is that a word?) and as my hair dries naturally, it's not frizzy or lifeless--it shows off my natural curls.  If I dry it with the blowdryer, it doesn't frizz at all.  I can flat iron it, and maybe because it really allows the hair to curl naturally, it takes a bit more work to get that curl out, but it looks GREAT.<br /><br />I have been using it for a month now, and my hair dresser actually noticed a difference in my hair. She said that it grew more than usual (she's been doing my hair for 3 years now, every 6 weeks).  I believe that because my hair doesn't break or frizz, my hair really is ""growing"" faster because it's not breaking off.<br /><br />I didn't think that any line could replace my Nexxus, but this has.  It took me a long time to find the Nexxus--with my sensitive hair that breaks so easily...  And it saves me money, too, which is a great thing, especially in this economy."
465,B007RTR89S,4,1340668800,"Let me say right up front that I haven't noticed any real change in my hair.  It hasn't been thicker or had less breakage or any of those things, but I still love this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR89S"">CLEAR Shampoo</a> because of the thickness of the suds.<br /><br />For years I've been a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISCZEE"">Pantene</a> user but I'm switching!<br /><br />Unlike other shampoos that suds up but tend to run if not washed away quickly, CLEAR is thick and doesn't run.  I actually scrub my hair and then leave it up while I finish showering then rinse.  And it just feels so good.<br /><br />As I said, though, even with my newfound shampoo love, I can't speak to it's ""special affects,"" because I haven't noticed any difference in my own hair.<br /><br />My hair is clean and shampooing feels good - that's enough for me!"
466,B007RTR89S,4,1340668800,"My unmanageable mane of hair currently falls to the middle of my back.  It's very fine, tangles easily and tends to confound many shampoos.  Given the amount of hair, I am used to having to use a lot of product just to work up a lather.  I've occasionally used some higher end brands and given up simply because I'm pouring out too much  at once trying to work up a lather.  It's hardly worth the price if I'm use a quarter of the bottle at a time.  Cheaper shampoos tend to fall into two categories, gloppy or watery enough to run out of my hand.  I've tended to use them because of price, but it's a quick suds and wash with the objective to get my hair rinsed as quickly as possible.<br /><br />This shampoo is neither gloppy nor too watery.  I can pop up the spout and use just about a quarter sized amount of shampoo to lather up the entire mass of hair.  It lathers quickly, with a pleasant texture and smell and rinses out without the feeling I've either dried my hair out  or left a stick residue.  My hair is noticeably more manageable, especially when I have to brush it out and detangle it (which is a chore).  I'm able to get it combed and ready for my day in about half the time it takes with cheaper shampoos. While I don't like this shampoo quite as much as the Shea shampoo, it's a wonderful go-to for my color weary hair that doesn't cost my grocery budget to buy.  As with all products, if you have sensitive skin, it's probably worthwhile to be cautious with anything not designed for sensitive skin.  I haven't had any problems with it, and my skin appears to be less dried out than usual after showers--which is a plus.<br /><br />^_^ Shanshad"
467,B007RTR89S,4,1340496000,"This shampoo is very good for your hair.  I have a scalp problem, plus I color my hair and this is a great product.  I use it with the conditioner and it leaves my hair very silky in spite of washing it often.  It is a pink creamy texture and the scent is terrific because it is not overpowering just a nice soft clean smell.  You will love it!"
468,B007RTR89S,4,1340323200,"I have used ths shampoo for a month or so. This bottle was the first i recieved from amazon but not the first i used. I'm very happy with it. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, lathers up quickly and rinses out easily. My hair when dry doesn't look weighed down the way it does with some other shampoos. It was shipped tightly wrapped in plastic and while there was a little leakage into the wrap it was completely contained and easily rinsed off from the bottle so it didn't concern me."
469,B007RTR89S,4,1340236800,"My husband and I tried this product along with the corresponding conditioner. His hair is dry, thinning, and brittle, very curly but not color treated. Mine is normal, slightly wavy, with good body, and salon colored.<br /><br />He likes this product for the moisturizing effect. We have tried just about every product we can find but his hair continues to be fragile.  This is the first product that he said actually makes a difference. His hair is softer and breaks less after only 2 weeks.<br /><br />For my color treated hair, it's made no positive difference. I don't like the texture feel of the hair when wet, and my color has faded twice as fast as it does using John Frieda shampoo for red hair.<br /><br />We'll probably keep buying this product for my husband's brittle hair, but I've stopped using it on mine."
470,B007RTR89S,5,1340236800,"I was surprised by how much I loved this shampoo. It is, after all, just shampoo. That said, the lather is very rich and the smell is fantastic. Has a hint of a berry smell. My hair always feels great after use. I am switching my brand!"
471,B007RTR89S,5,1340236800,"This is my first time using this shampoo and I was very happy with it.  The product is smooth, has a wonderfully pleasant aroma --not too strong-- and lathers up well.  My hair felt soft and shiny, and after using nearly the entire bottle I haven't experienced any build-up or other strange after-effects.  I did not use it with the conditioner, so I don't know what their combined effect would be, but I would recommend the shampoo and will likely use it again."
472,B007RTR89S,4,1340236800,"I ordered both the Clear Scalp Shampoo and the Conditioner for Damage and Color Repair since I regularly color my dark hair and like to use products that help sustain the color. I typically buy sulfate-free since those seem to work best, and was a little bit surprised that this formula contained sulfates. However, I didn't notice any negative difference in my color after using it for a just few weeks.<br /><br />The shampoo did seem to be a thorough cleanser,leaving my hair ""squeaky clean"" and once I added the conditioner it left my hair soft and silky as I stepped out of the shower. I found the scent clean and pleasant and it doesn't linger at all after rinsing.<br /><br />Once blow-dried, it did seem that the shampoo might have been a bit of a stronger cleanser than I am used to since my hair was slightly fluffier than usual. It could also be that the conditioner was not as deep conditioning as I have found with other products made for color-treated or damaged hair. I should note that I have relatively ""normal-dry"" wavy hair and this might be a bit more ideal for those who have ""oily-normal"" hair.<br /><br />I would recommend this combo to anyone looking for a super clean head of hair with body, but not to anyone who tends to have dry hair to begin with since it may be a bit too harsh. I also wonder about long term use on color treated hair with a product that contains sulfates, since I prefer those without. They performed pretty well, so I did give the shampoo/conditioner 4 stars, but it could have had 5 if it were sulfate-free."
473,B007RTR89S,4,1340236800,For the shampoo: This smells really nice and my hair is shiny and soft. As for is it is helping me damaged scalp? I don't think anyone would really be able to tell. I trust the scientific formula the smart guys put in it that it will actually make my scalp healthier. I do really like the scent and how soft and feathery my hair is after using this repeatedly. I also got the conditioner with it and use them together.
474,B007RTR89S,4,1340150400,"If you were a child of the 80's you will feel a definite sense of deja vu with this product! The smell and feel of it reminded me instantly of PermaSoft. The next closest smell would be Pert Plus. It's the same manufacturer as Pert Plus so that makes sense.<br /><br />This shampoo did a great job of removing hairstyling product buildup without stripping my hair, and I didn't have to shampoo twice to achieve that. I tested it on 3-day-old gross hair, and one wash removed all the buildup and gunk! I used it without a follow up conditioner and my hair was not frizzy, dry, or flyaway like it normally would be with what I consider a 'drugstore product'. It was very soft and had soft waves, no frizz.<br /><br />I normally only use a few certain salon brands on my hair because I have it colored and I use a flatiron a lot (lots of damage potential there!); I would consider this brand of shampoo to be an acceptable substitute and not worry too much that it's stripping my color in the meantime.<br /><br />I would buy this."
475,B007RTR89S,4,1340064000,"I was a bit skeptical about this item.  But the shampoo smells great and works well.  It puts a lot of hydration in my hair, especially at the ends, which always seem to be dry and splitting.  I haven't tried it with its corresponding conditioner, but I feel that would even be better and I am happy with using only the shampoo then my usual conditioner."
476,B007RTR89S,4,1340064000,"The shampoo is opaque, with a slightly pinkish color. It is very smooth and comes out of the bottle easily.  Note the bottle opens at the top, whereas that of the conditioner opens at the bottom. Also the bottle is skinny, so it looks to hold more than its 12.9 fluid ounces or 381 milliliters.  It did not irritate my scalp and was smooth to apply.  If you have really filthy, greasy hair then <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XQ7LOS"">Dawn Ultra Dishwashing Liquid, Original Scent, Blue,  24 Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> would provide a stronger degreasing effect, but it could make the hair dry.  So the shampoo has to be rubbed in for a while to remove dirt well. Then the hair has to be rinsed to remove the bubbles and other shampoo ingredients.<br /><br />I tried it twice - the first time I did not use conditioner.  The second time, after I used the shampoo I used <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>.  The shampoo was so creamy that I thought it might be possible to avoid using conditioner - the results were OK - my hair was not frizzy. However, with the conditioner it became quite shiny and silky.<br /><br />I am not commenting on the toxicity or lack of toxicity of the ingredients.  I am giving an ingredient list so readers can find what is in the product.  The ingredients in common with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> are:<br /><br />Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract<br />Ascorbic Acid<br />Dimethiconol<br />DMDM Hydantoin<br />Fragrance<br />Glycerin<br />Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil<br />Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil<br />Hydrogenated Coconut Oil<br />Lysine HCI<br />Methychloroisothiaszolinone<br />Methylisothiaszolinone<br />Niacinamide<br />Panthenol<br />Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil<br />Red 33 (CL 17200)<br />Sodium Chloride<br />TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate<br />Tocopheryl Acetate<br />Water<br />Zinc Pyrithione<br />Zinc Sulphate<br /><br />The ingredients in the shampoo and not in the conditioner are:<br />Bismuth Oxychloride (Cl 77163)<br />Carbomer<br />Citric Acid<br />Cocomidopropyl Betaine<br />Dimethicone<br />Guar Hydroxypeopyltrimonium Chloride<br />Mica (Cl 77019)<br />Poloxamer 407<br />Sodium Isethionate<br />Sodium Laureth Sulfate<br />Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate<br />Stearic Acid<br />Tallow Acid<br />Titanium Dioxide (CL 77891)<br />Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Ingredients in the conditioner and not in the shampoo are:<br />Behentrimonium Chloride<br />Cetearyl Alcohol - emulsifier, foaming agent<br />Cyclopentasiloxane - silicone to stop hair breaking<br />Dimethylamine<br />Dipropylene  Glycol<br />Lactic Acid<br />PEG-150 Distearate<br />Stearamidopropyl<br /><br />I may have missed some ingredients in common as some ingredients have multiple names and shampoo labeling tends to be inconsistent.<br /><br />As you can see there are multiple chemicals. The shampoo claims it has 10 vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />I prefer shampoos with simpler ingredient lists.  Despite various nut and seed oils, this is really a chemical-based shampoo.  However, the shampoo works well and provides a high quality wash. It does what it claims to do - repairs damage. With 4 coloring agents at least (that make the shampoo the same hue as the bottle), I assume it ""repairs color"" - whatever that means!<br /><br />I wish the ingredients weren't hidden under the label - as it was they came off with the label and I had to scan them from behind then reflect them in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EUBSL0"">Adobe Photoshop CS4 - Old Version</a> to read them."
477,B007RTR89S,5,1340064000,"I have naturally light colored hair...aka grey/white...lol but wanted to<br />try this to see if it would help soften it a bit more cause lets face it,<br />grey hair has a mind of its own!  I liked this, my hair felt very clean<br />and a nice scent.  I also liked the shape of the bottle, most people could<br />care less about that, I have small and arthritic hands, so appreciate a<br />bottle I can grip and hold without dropping it.  It was also used by my<br />husband, well...he says its shampoo...lol  I liked this and also tried<br />the matching conditioner and reviewed that product too."
478,B007RTR89S,5,1340064000,"I live in a dry climate with hard water and colored hair and that equals dry skin and dry hair. I'm skeptical about hair product claims because I have found that products vary only slightly - if at all - from the cheapest products to the most expensive. But Clear Scalp and Hair is distinctly different. After about a week of use I actually could tell that my scalp was less dry - I didn't have flakes and  it didn't feel tight after a hot shower. My hair is prone to oiliness, and I didn't experience excessive oiliness with this product, nor did it weigh my hair down. It also smells great, which is a bonus.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say I have found my new shampoo - it works great."
479,B007RTR89S,5,1339977600,"This shampoo foams up very well and doesn't fade your color.  Leaves your hair soft and shiny and rinses out well leaving no residue.  All in all, just what a shampoo for color-treated hair should be."
480,B007RTR89S,5,1339891200,After watching commercials I wanted to give this a try and I was so happy I did. Best shampoo/conditioner I have used In my life and i have really damaged color highlited hair!!!! This actually makes your hair silky soft and the smell lasts in your hair the whole day. The conditioner works better than my neutrogena deep conditioner by far
481,B007RTR89S,4,1339804800,"I have been having my hair highlighted for years, so I am always looking for products that care-take long-colored hair.  At the same time, I have oily hair and need to wash it daily.  This product has been surprisingly good.<br /><br />The shampoo itself has a nice consistency and a pleasant fragrance that, in my opinion, does not overpower.  It lathers well, and my scalp has had no issues with either dryness or oiliness.  In addition, my color has looked better - something that friends/colleagues have remarked on since I began using this.<br /><br />I like to switch off my shampoos, and I could definitely see keeping this in the rotation."
482,B007RTR89S,5,1339718400,"I have been using the CLEAR Damage & Color Repair shampoo with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8TS"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> for two weeks now. While I don't know if my hair is stronger, I can definitely see a difference in the shine. Also, my color hasn't visibly faded while using it. But what I love most about this shampoo is the scent. I can't really pin it down--it's maybe slightly fruity?--but it reminds me of the Matrix Biolage shampoo I used to buy simply because I loved the scent. Since this is a fraction of the Biolage price, I think I'll stick with CLEAR!"
483,B007RTR89S,4,1339632000,"First of all I want to say that I also had a problem with my shampoo bottle breaking and getting everywhere during shipping. In my case, it was UPS's fault since the package actually had foot prints on it and looked beat up. Amazon was quick to reship me a new bottle that arrived fine. If you have this issue, Amazon is willing to fix it for you.<br /><br />On to the shampoo..I normally alternate between Herbal Essences, Pantene Pro-V and Aussie. I have straight, thick, long, highlighted hair. I was a little disappointed to see that this shampoo has Sodium Laureth Sulfate in it. Sodium Laureth Sulfate is known for being bad for colored hair, so I am not sure why it is in this ""Color Repair"" shampoo.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is thick and creamy and has a slightly pink color. It has a really nice almost floral scent. It lathers well and you don't have to use a ton of it. Honestly, it feels like Pantene Pro-V. It leaves your hair feeling clean, soft and healthy. However, I don't think it does anything to repair your color. The Sodium Laureth Sulfate may even harm it. My hair is not damaged, so I can not attest to that part of the shampoo claim.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the shampoo and will buy it in the future, but only if it is on sale."
484,B007RTR89S,5,1339545600,"I'm always careful about products for my color treated ""naturally blonde"" hair. This shampoo is thick and creamy, goes on smoothly, has a fresh and very pleasant scent and does a very nice job. My hair is silky and smooth after use, and I've noticed it doesn't get so flyaway in humid weather. This goes great with the matching conditioner, of course. Highly recommend."
485,B007RTR89S,4,1339459200,"I tend to have a flaky and dry scalp. I occasionally use dandruff shampoos and they help somewhat. When I saw this new shampoo, I thought I'd give it a go. I'd prefer to use a ""regular"" shampoo than a special one so it seemed worth a try.<br /><br />The CLEAR shampoo is very thick. It lathers up quite nicely and stays on your head rather than dripping down. It seemed thicker than any other shampoo I tried -- more like a conditioner than a shampoo. After using it for a week or so, I'd have to say that my scalp felt less itchy and dry. I didn't notice any significant other changes -- my hair wasn't shinier or easier to manage but I did think it help clear up my scalp issues somewhat.<br /><br />The smell is subtle and not too strong.<br /><br />I would use this shampoo again."
486,B007RTR89S,4,1339372800,"I've been using this shampoo exclusively for a couple of weeks and will continue using it.  The scent is difficult to pin down: it's a light scent and reminds me of the smell of shampoo at my hairdresser's but it doesn't really smell like anything (mint, fruit, spice).  It has pleasant lather and leaves my hair manageable.  I'm not sure that using this will keep my color from fading more rapidly than it does, but it's not a bad shampoo.<br /><br />I have fairly thick wavy hair and live in a humid climate--so I appreciate the fact that my hair does not frizz much with this product.<br /><br />The only problem I had was with the delivery of the shampoo. Although it was wrapped in plastic, the cap was not secured and about 1/3 of the bottle emptied into the shipping envelope.  I don't think I'd ever order shampoo in the mail after that experience."
487,B007RTR89S,3,1339372800,"I find it odd that a color safe shampoo would contain sulfates. Beware if you are trying to avoid them, especially if you have any kind of keratin treatment.<br /><br />The shampoo lathers well, and smells nice. I didn't see a noticable difference in my scalp being less dry, though. It is an okay product, but I don't see myself using it again."
488,B007RTR89S,4,1339286400,"I have wavy hair which I wear blow dried and flat ironed. It has a tendency to be dry, and it is very prone to frizziness.<br />I have tried a lot of products (of various costs) to try to make my hair shiny, straight, and non-frizzy.<br />I received this shampoo, and the accompanying conditioner a couple of weeks ago, and have been using them exclusively, without using any additional products.<br />The shampoo is packaged in a very usable bottle, it is easy to get the shampoo out, even with hands that are wet and slippery.<br />The shampoo is very sudsy, and has almost no odor. Even though there are lots of suds, they rinse out very easily. My hair feels clean and soft after shampooing.<br />I have not used the shampoo without the conditioner, so the comments are for both products used together.<br />After towel drying my hair, it is relatively easy to comb through, although there are some small tangles. After blow drying my hair is really soft and nice, and the flat iron straightens it very well.<br />I have noticed, though, that my hair has a tendency to be somewhat fly-away with this product, so I will try to use a leave-in product as well.<br />Since I live in Florida, humidity is a big problem, and I do not find this product to help with frizziness.<br />All in all I really like this shampoo, and I would give it 5 stars if I lived in a less humid area."
489,B007RTR89S,5,1339200000,i gave this to the wife for her to use.  after a couple of applications she said that it did help her hair and was repairing the split ends.  she said wouldn't know about the color repair since her hair is turning silver anyway.  looking at her hair it seemed to me that it seemed fluffier and the color was a little bit bolder-but hey what does a man know.
490,B007RTR89S,2,1339200000,"I am a big fan of Suave and since this product is made by the same company, I jumped at the chance to try something new from them. I have to say my review may be tainted by the way the product came to me. First, when the package arrived, it was leaking. The bottle was inside a plastic bag which must have been made to seal in any leakage. I don't know if it was broken or the button on top somehow got pushed, but half of the bottle of shampoo was out. Once I cut off the wrapping and threw away the spoils, the bottle seemed okay. I put it in my shower, eager to try it the next morning.<br />The shampoo itself is okay. It smells and feels like the ""color seal"" shampoo you get in a hair-dye box for after rinsing. I'm not found of that sort of smell everyday, but it's not unpleasant. After using the shampoo for a couple of days, my hair felt limp and oily compared to using Suave shampoo and conditioner (I like to use Mango Mandarin, Citrus Smoothie, or Apple). For someone who's hair is usually light, healthy, and shiny, I did not like the effect this shampoo gave to my hair. For someone who tends to have dry scalp, it might help you. I stopped using it after a week.<br />After a few uses, the bottle started leaking from the (almost) invisible seam holding the lid on. I don't know if I got a messed up bottle or if this is how they all are. I would not buy this again."
491,B007RTR89S,2,1339200000,"I am a die hard salon product user, usually <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMLRWO"">Aveda Color Conserve Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BIXP3A"">Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo, 8-Ounce Bottle</a> as I color my hair every 6 weeks at the salon. So a product really has to be good to get my approval. Clear falls short.<br /><br />It will clean your hair, but the quality here is very much more grocery store - you get what you pay for. Its claims to give one a healthier scalp are unfounded, in my opinion, as there was no decrease in scalp dryness over weeks of use. For a truly healthy scalp, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTFP0I"">Nioxin Cleanser, System 2 (Fine/Noticeably Thinning ), 33.8 Ounce</a> and pair it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4GIPM"">Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 3 (Fine/Treated/Normal to Thin-Looking), 33.8 Ounce</a>.<br /><br />The scent of Clear lingers all day, but it does this by being overpowering. Hair is not nourished, feeling dry and fly away after use."
492,B007RTR89S,5,1338940800,"I gave my wife the new ""CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy shampoo and conditioner for damage and color repair"" for her birthday.  She is picky about her hair products and has trained me to purchase only those for color treated hair, though she rarely admits to having color added.  I've learned my lesson, about her pickiness, when buying shampoo and conditioner, but I dared to try something new.<br /><br />Whew! Did I ever score with CLEAR!  She told me ""the bottle shapes are so cute, and the open/close mechanism was very secure,"" something she doesn't always find on her regular brands.  She also said she doesn't need to use as big a portion to clean as she has before, making it very economical.  She said the suds felt thick, smooth, and it had a nice mild scent.<br /><br />After just a couple days of use, and especially after a full week of daily use, she thought her hair was indeed shinier thatn before, had much better texture, and seemed smooth, manageable, and extremely soft.  Usually in the humidity of warm weather she has the ""frizzies.""  When the CLEAR runs out, she asked me to get her more.  Boy, do I now have little gifts for future occasions--the jackpot of suprise gift-giving!"
493,B007RTR89S,4,1338940800,"This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and lathers quickly and efficiently (even in pretty hard water). My hair is color-treated and on the dry and thick side. The first time I used this product, my hair felt more dry, but after a few shampoos, I find that it leaves my hair feeling comparatively clean and soft. It is definitely best applied with the companion conditioner (clear scalp and hair beauty damage and color repair nourishing conditioner). A good choice for the price."
494,B007RTR89S,5,1338940800,"I have very fine, long and thin hair that I color to hide the gray.  I also live in the northern part of the country and during the colder months my hair is SO dry it is like straw.  I tried the Clear Scalp conditioner, and really liked it, so I broke down to try the Clear Scalp shampoo.  I got this one because my hair is colored and so dry that I would call it a bit damaged.  I tried this shampoo with the conditioner and didn't need to add any leave in conditioner after my shower - this stuff just really cleaned my hair and conditioned it so well that I just blow dried it and was good to go.  I am very happy with this product, and I love the smell.  I would recommend this and buy it again."
495,B007RTR89S,5,1338854400,"I've been using both the shampoo and conditioner for a few days now. It has a nice long lasting fragrance. My hair feels clean and soft. I reitterate SOFT. I go the salon on a regular basis to have my hair colored. I use shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair and some have left my hair feeling dry. Not the case with Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty. It really left my hair feeling soft through out the day.<br /><br />Another bonus: for people like me, who need eye glasses to read and have a hard time deciphering which bottle is the shampoo and which is the conditioner, the shape of both bottles is not only very helpful but is also very clever. Both bottles have a flat spot and you push down for the spot to open and dispense shampoo or conditioner. The shampoo sits up right with the spot on the top and the conditioner sits with the spot on the bottom. No problem with trying to figure out which bottle is the shampoo or conditioner.<br /><br />I liked this product and will be purchasing more."
496,B007RTR89S,4,1338854400,"For the last 12 years I have colored my hair religiously every 3 months. For the last 11 years I spent countless dollars on salon products and finally decided that their has to be other products that work as well if not better. I am surprised I liked this shampoo as much as I did because I have been using sulfate free however I did assume that since this was ""Clear"" it was also sulfate free however it is the second ingredient on the list. Lathers well, great scent, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Color is very vibrant however I will alternate after this bottle finishes back to my sulfate free and then back to this just to change it up."
497,B007RTR89S,3,1338854400,"I actually bought this shampoo at the supermarket.  The reason I give it 3 stars is the bottle lid design.  It is WAY too easy for the top to open in a bag, box or whatever.  The checkout person bagged this shampoo by itself which was a godsend because the top tipped open and half the contents were in the bag.  I would expect many more negative comments like this one unless they change their lid design or tape off the top so it can't tip to the open position.  I liked the scent of the shampoo (on the strong side) and thought it cleaned well, left my hair full bodied and my scalp moisturized.  I agree with another poster about the SLS.  I primarily use WEN or Loreal Creme (LOVE IT) and my bleached hair looks wonderful after being severely damaged due to bleaching and nutritional problems.  Clear did not give me the luminosity and shine or define my color hair the way the creme poo does.  I will only use whats left on occassion when I want a fluffier style."
498,B007RTR89S,5,1338768000,"I have thick shoulder-length hair that every 3 - 4 months my salonist either colors or highlights (and chops away some of the thickness so I don't look like a wooly mammoth).  For this reason, I switched from using my usual brand, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCWDDE"">Fructis Sleek and Shine fortifying Shampoo By Garnier for Unisex Shampoo, 13 Ounce</a>, to this brand.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This was used in conjunction with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8TS"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>.<br /><br />I rather liked the packaging.  It is a little similar to the Clear Conditioner, but fortunately, I have sharp eyes.  The shampoo itself had a nice, light pleasant smell, and a good consistency (neither too thick, nor too thin and watery).<br /><br />I started out with about a palm-sized amount of shampoo--what normally would have been just enough with my regular brand.  I quickly found out that this was too much for the Clear shampoo.  It lathers quite nicely and also rinses out quite easily.<br /><br />But the end results were what stunned me.  My hair was delightfully soft and smooth!  After flat-ironing my hair, my hair was sleek and flat in a way that I could only rarely get from my usual hair products.  But the best part was when a coworker approached me and asked if I had recently gone in to have my hair cut and colored.  I told him, no, my last appointment was a month ago!<br /><br />I am now a convert; I'm saying goodbye to Garnier Fructus, and hello to Clear and better hair!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*"
499,B007RTR89S,5,1338768000,"I can't say enough good things about the Clear Scalp & Hair line. The product delivers exactly what it claims to do...beautiful, clean hair. The shampoo is creamy and silky with a very rich lather. It rinses well without a filmy residue left behind. The scent is light and pleasing and not overpowering like some leading shampoos on the market. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that I wish it came in a bigger size! Definitely worth the money!"
500,B007RTR89S,3,1338768000,"For a product that is supposed to nourish damaged and colored hair, I was surprised that the second ingredient is sodium laurel sulfate, a harsh, cheap ingredient to help foaming/lather.  I've started buying soaps and shampoos without sodium laurel sulfate.<br /><br />I also found the fragrance too strong.<br /><br />When it arrived, it was wrapped in plastic, in a padded envelope. The envelop had been squeezed so some of the shampoo squished out.  I could smell the shampoo through the envelop.<br /><br />My hair is soft and clean. My scalp is clean.<br /><br />It's OK but I don't think I'd get it again.<br /><br />AUGUST 21, 2012 UPDATE:<br />I've been using a Conditioning - Shampoo (like Wen) for a couple of weeks and find Clear Scalp and Hair is a MUST - at least once a week.  The conditioning shampoos clean the hair but not the scalp.  Clear SCALP and Hair is extremely helpful - actually necessary - to clean ""debris"" aka dandruff so I can enjoy a conditioning  shampoo. : )"
501,B007RTR89S,4,1338508800,"I have color-treated (all-over blonde highlights) and very fine hair... but a lot of it! I originally tried the volumizing shampoo and condition by Clear but I needed more moisture. This one is great!<br /><br />Even with the first washing my hair was more manageable, styled better, and was so shiney and bright! One of the guys I work with said it looked blonder and asked if I just got it done!<br /><br />I know it has sulfate but my hair looks great anyway!"
502,B007RTR89S,5,1338422400,I love this shampoo!!<br />my hair is silky and smells wonderful and the dirt<br />is gone! just one washing did it.<br />i color my hair and the color was brighter not dull and there<br />was no color rinsed out while washing.<br /><br />2 definate thumbs up!!
503,B000XSJLW2,5,1196640000,These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.<br /><br />I found them to be very sweet.<br />Makes a great snack or even dessert!
504,B000XSJLW2,5,1196640000,"The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."
505,B000XSJLW2,5,1194998400,Delicious as breakfast or a snack.<br />I bought these as an alternative to<br />non-organic cereal & milk for breakfast.<br /><br />They were a big hit & I do not have to keep<br />non-organic milk on hand.  I have not been<br />able to find organic powdered milk they will<br />drink.
506,B000XSJLW2,4,1193875200,"I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.  These make a great snack.  They are very sweet.  I cannot eat just one which is probably bad.  I think I am going to try the unfrosted variety to see if they are less sweet."
507,B000XSJLW2,4,1182902400,Toast it for 1 min. perfect breakfast. I wish it was a little less sweet though.
508,B000XSJLW2,2,1181779200,"Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan."
509,B000XSJLW2,3,1191196800,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
510,B000XSJLW2,2,1258848000,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
511,B000XSJLW2,2,1255132800,"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
512,B000XSJLW2,1,1328659200,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain!

513,B000XSJLW2,3,1237680000,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
514,B000XSJLW2,5,1176508800,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."
515,B000XSJLW2,5,1149638400,The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels.

They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
516,B000XSJLW2,5,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry"
517,B000XSJLW2,5,1168473600,"These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
518,B000XSJLW2,5,1198972800,"First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
519,B000XSJLW2,5,1189641600,"I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite."
520,B000XSJLW2,5,1164326400,These toaster pastries are very very good.These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts.You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack..
521,B000XSJLW2,5,1201910400,"I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND."
522,B000XSJLW2,5,1199923200,"These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them ""Purple Flurp"" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too)."
523,B000XSJLW2,5,1197244800,"I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry."
524,B000XSJLW2,4,1200614400,"Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much..."

526,B000XSJLW2,5,1160179200,"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase."
527,B000XSJLW2,5,1169942400,"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor."
528,B000XSJLW2,4,1187136000,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
529,B000XSJLW2,5,1196640000,"I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes."
530,B000XSJLW2,4,1193961600,These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!

533,B000XSJLW2,5,1155513600,"Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!"
534,B000XSJLW2,5,1238371200,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door.
535,B000XSJLW2,4,1209340800,"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box."

537,B000XSJLW2,5,1230422400,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure."
538,B000XSJLW2,5,1226534400,i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
539,B000XSJLW2,5,1204848000,"Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!"
540,B000XSJLW2,5,1202428800,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
541,B000XSJLW2,5,1200873600,"One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients."
542,B000XSJLW2,4,1189987200,"These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
543,B000XSJLW2,3,1181779200,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
544,B000XSJLW2,5,1329350400,"Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!"
545,B000XSJLW2,5,1283299200,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
546,B000XSJLW2,5,1272499200,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
547,B000XSJLW2,5,1243209600,"My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard ""pop-tarts"", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement. Well folks here it is, my kids eat them all the time, they make a perfect snack that is not junk. I wish more variety packages were available. I absolutely reccomend this product in all flavors."
548,B000XSJLW2,5,1237248000,these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry
549,B000XSJLW2,5,1236124800,My wife & mom really like these.  They are really good & replace the breakfast rush meal
550,B000XSJLW2,4,1221350400,"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!"
551,B000XSJLW2,5,1219190400,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
552,B000XSJLW2,5,1215820800,"I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!"
553,B000XSJLW2,5,1206921600,"My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."

556,B000XSJLW2,5,1182297600,"Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second. Also tasty right out of the package for an on-the-go snack."
557,B000XSJLW2,4,1174867200,"a little dry, but given that they're pretty healthy (all things considered), i'm willing to forgive..."
558,B000XSJLW2,5,1172102400,"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."

560,B000XSJLW2,4,1168646400,It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
561,B000XSJLW2,5,1187827200,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run.  They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
562,B000XSJLW2,5,1181260800,Recommended.  Good price when bought in bulk.
563,B000XSJLW2,5,1177804800,These are delicious! They are much better and much better for you and the planet than more processed alternatives.
564,B000XSJLW2,5,1214438400,"These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
565,B000XSJLW2,5,1350518400,"Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.  Getting them from Amazon is even better, because they are much cheaper.  Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon."
566,B000XSJLW2,4,1347926400,"We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."
567,B000XSJLW2,5,1344556800,"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support."
568,B000XSJLW2,5,1343347200,"I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of ""food,"" is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more."
569,B000XSJLW2,5,1342310400,"First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a ""healthy"" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation."
570,B000XSJLW2,5,1340755200,"What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth."
571,B000XSJLW2,5,1337472000,This is a great price for a healthy food for my kids!  Like the convenience of purchasing and scheduling deliveries when needed.
572,B000XSJLW2,5,1318982400,"My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat."
573,B000XSJLW2,5,1316736000,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
574,B000XSJLW2,5,1302134400,I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.  Amazon has a lower price than my local grocers.
575,B000XSJLW2,4,1299110400,"I like these, paltry on the frosting! Can see right through it, not just in one spot, all of it."
576,B000XSJLW2,5,1298246400,"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
577,B000XSJLW2,4,1297814400,"The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly."
578,B000XSJLW2,5,1294358400,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
579,B000XSJLW2,5,1291939200,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
580,B000XSJLW2,5,1288915200,"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"
581,B000XSJLW2,5,1284681600,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
582,B000XSJLW2,5,1282521600,These are the best toaster pasties we have had. Nature's Path has the best flavors and ingredients and at a good price - a good deal and good for you all around. I purchase them over and over. My husband loves them. Everyone that tries them loves them. And the best part is they are organic too!
583,B000XSJLW2,5,1277596800,"Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets."
584,B000XSJLW2,4,1276732800,organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.
585,B000XSJLW2,3,1275782400,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
586,B000XSJLW2,5,1274054400,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
587,B000XSJLW2,5,1269993600,"I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or ""pomegran"" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!"
588,B000XSJLW2,5,1268438400,"If you like pop tarts these taste great and are ""healthy"" (well as healthy as a sweet, frosted pop tart can get anyway). If you are going to buy pop tarts for your kids, spend the extra money and buy these,"
589,B000XSJLW2,5,1267056000,"I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good. Good flavor, nice quick and easy snack."
590,B000XSJLW2,5,1265414400,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
591,B000XSJLW2,5,1261872000,A good breakfast or snack option for kids on the go- and without all the icky additives.  We all like them!  Buy them with the Subscribe and Save and they are a great deal!
592,B000XSJLW2,5,1260835200,These are great.  Loved em.  My only complaint I guess would be the price here.  I bought a 32 count box of these at Costco for only 7.99.  You could buy the same quantity for about half the cost there vs here.
593,B000XSJLW2,5,1253577600,"I prefer natural foods with minimal processing, and we are kosher. This is an amazing product. Excellent for any time of the day, good for snacks, or along with breakfast. My kids love them, and I kind of like them too."
594,B000XSJLW2,5,1245888000,"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community."
595,B000XSJLW2,4,1244505600,I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.
596,B000XSJLW2,5,1240012800,"These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up."
597,B000XSJLW2,4,1228521600,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
598,B000XSJLW2,5,1223251200,Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type. Convenient when they need a quick breakfast or after school snack. We buy the strawberry and blueberry often.
599,B000XSJLW2,3,1219622400,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories.  A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
600,B000XSJLW2,5,1210377600,My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :)
601,B000XSJLW2,4,1208649600,"With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children."
602,B000XSJLW2,5,1208131200,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
603,B000XSJLW2,3,1202169600,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
604,B000E4ALHY,5,1196640000,These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.<br /><br />I found them to be very sweet.<br />Makes a great snack or even dessert!
605,B000E4ALHY,5,1196640000,"The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."
606,B000E4ALHY,5,1194998400,Delicious as breakfast or a snack.<br />I bought these as an alternative to<br />non-organic cereal & milk for breakfast.<br /><br />They were a big hit & I do not have to keep<br />non-organic milk on hand.  I have not been<br />able to find organic powdered milk they will<br />drink.
607,B000E4ALHY,4,1193875200,"I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.  These make a great snack.  They are very sweet.  I cannot eat just one which is probably bad.  I think I am going to try the unfrosted variety to see if they are less sweet."
608,B000E4ALHY,4,1182902400,Toast it for 1 min. perfect breakfast. I wish it was a little less sweet though.
609,B000E4ALHY,2,1181779200,"Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan."
610,B000E4ALHY,3,1191196800,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
611,B000E4ALHY,2,1258848000,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
612,B000E4ALHY,2,1255132800,"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
613,B000E4ALHY,1,1328659200,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber...Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!<br /><br />Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Invert, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Palm Oil, Organic Whole Wheat Flour"
614,B000E4ALHY,3,1237680000,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
615,B000E4ALHY,5,1176508800,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."
616,B000E4ALHY,5,1149638400,The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
617,B000E4ALHY,5,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry"
618,B000E4ALHY,5,1168473600,"These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
619,B000E4ALHY,5,1198972800,"First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
620,B000E4ALHY,5,1189641600,"I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite."
621,B000E4ALHY,5,1164326400,These toaster pastries are very very good.These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts.You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack..
622,B000E4ALHY,5,1201910400,"I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND."
623,B000E4ALHY,5,1199923200,"These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them ""Purple Flurp"" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too)."
624,B000E4ALHY,5,1197244800,"I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry."
625,B000E4ALHY,4,1200614400,"Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much..."

627,B000E4ALHY,5,1160179200,"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy.

628,B000E4ALHY,5,1169942400,"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor."
629,B000E4ALHY,4,1187136000,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
630,B000E4ALHY,5,1196640000,"I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes."
631,B000E4ALHY,4,1193961600,These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!

634,B000E4ALHY,5,1155513600,"Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!"
635,B000E4ALHY,5,1238371200,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door.
636,B000E4ALHY,4,1209340800,"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box."

638,B000E4ALHY,5,1230422400,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure."
639,B000E4ALHY,5,1226534400,i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
640,B000E4ALHY,5,1204848000,"Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!"
641,B000E4ALHY,5,1202428800,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
642,B000E4ALHY,5,1200873600,"One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients."
643,B000E4ALHY,4,1189987200,"These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
644,B000E4ALHY,3,1181779200,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
645,B000E4ALHY,5,1329350400,"Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!"
646,B000E4ALHY,5,1283299200,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
647,B000E4ALHY,5,1272499200,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
648,B000E4ALHY,5,1243209600,"My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard ""pop-tarts"", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement. Well folks here it is, my kids eat them all the time, they make a perfect snack that is not junk. I wish more variety packages were available. I absolutely reccomend this product in all flavors."
649,B000E4ALHY,5,1237248000,these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry
650,B000E4ALHY,5,1236124800,My wife & mom really like these.  They are really good & replace the breakfast rush meal
651,B000E4ALHY,4,1221350400,"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!"
652,B000E4ALHY,5,1219190400,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
653,B000E4ALHY,5,1215820800,"I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!"
654,B000E4ALHY,5,1206921600,"My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."
655,B000E4ALHY,5,1190937600,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Apple Cinnamon are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these."
656,B000E4ALHY,5,1190937600,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Blueberry Frosted are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these."
657,B000E4ALHY,5,1182297600,"Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second. Also tasty right out of the package for an on-the-go snack."
658,B000E4ALHY,4,1174867200,"a little dry, but given that they're pretty healthy (all things considered), i'm willing to forgive..."
659,B000E4ALHY,5,1172102400,"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."
660,B000E4ALHY,4,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry<br /><br />(hence 4 stars for this flavor, rather than 5)"
661,B000E4ALHY,4,1168646400,It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
662,B000E4ALHY,5,1187827200,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run.  They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
663,B000E4ALHY,5,1181260800,Recommended.  Good price when bought in bulk.
664,B000E4ALHY,5,1177804800,These are delicious! They are much better and much better for you and the planet than more processed alternatives.
665,B000E4ALHY,5,1214438400,"These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
666,B000E4ALHY,5,1350518400,"Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.  Getting them from Amazon is even better, because they are much cheaper.  Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon."
667,B000E4ALHY,4,1347926400,"We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."
668,B000E4ALHY,5,1344556800,"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support."
669,B000E4ALHY,5,1343347200,"I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of ""food,"" is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more."
670,B000E4ALHY,5,1342310400,"First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a ""healthy"" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation."
671,B000E4ALHY,5,1340755200,"What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth."
672,B000E4ALHY,5,1337472000,This is a great price for a healthy food for my kids!  Like the convenience of purchasing and scheduling deliveries when needed.
673,B000E4ALHY,5,1318982400,"My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat."
674,B000E4ALHY,5,1316736000,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
675,B000E4ALHY,5,1302134400,I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.  Amazon has a lower price than my local grocers.
676,B000E4ALHY,4,1299110400,"I like these, paltry on the frosting! Can see right through it, not just in one spot, all of it."
677,B000E4ALHY,5,1298246400,"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
678,B000E4ALHY,4,1297814400,"The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly."
679,B000E4ALHY,5,1294358400,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
680,B000E4ALHY,5,1291939200,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
681,B000E4ALHY,5,1288915200,"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"
682,B000E4ALHY,5,1284681600,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
683,B000E4ALHY,5,1282521600,These are the best toaster pasties we have had. Nature's Path has the best flavors and ingredients and at a good price - a good deal and good for you all around. I purchase them over and over. My husband loves them. Everyone that tries them loves them. And the best part is they are organic too!
684,B000E4ALHY,5,1277596800,"Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets."
685,B000E4ALHY,4,1276732800,organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.
686,B000E4ALHY,3,1275782400,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
687,B000E4ALHY,5,1274054400,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
688,B000E4ALHY,5,1269993600,"I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or ""pomegran"" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!"
689,B000E4ALHY,5,1268438400,"If you like pop tarts these taste great and are ""healthy"" (well as healthy as a sweet, frosted pop tart can get anyway). If you are going to buy pop tarts for your kids, spend the extra money and buy these,"
690,B000E4ALHY,5,1267056000,"I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good. Good flavor, nice quick and easy snack."
691,B000E4ALHY,5,1265414400,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
692,B000E4ALHY,5,1261872000,A good breakfast or snack option for kids on the go- and without all the icky additives.  We all like them!  Buy them with the Subscribe and Save and they are a great deal!
693,B000E4ALHY,5,1260835200,These are great.  Loved em.  My only complaint I guess would be the price here.  I bought a 32 count box of these at Costco for only 7.99.  You could buy the same quantity for about half the cost there vs here.
694,B000E4ALHY,5,1253577600,"I prefer natural foods with minimal processing, and we are kosher. This is an amazing product. Excellent for any time of the day, good for snacks, or along with breakfast. My kids love them, and I kind of like them too."
695,B000E4ALHY,5,1245888000,"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community."
696,B000E4ALHY,4,1244505600,I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.
697,B000E4ALHY,5,1240012800,"These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up."
698,B000E4ALHY,4,1228521600,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
699,B000E4ALHY,5,1223251200,Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type. Convenient when they need a quick breakfast or after school snack. We buy the strawberry and blueberry often.
700,B000E4ALHY,3,1219622400,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories.  A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
701,B000E4ALHY,5,1210377600,My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :)
702,B000E4ALHY,4,1208649600,"With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children."
703,B000E4ALHY,5,1208131200,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
704,B000E4ALHY,3,1202169600,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
705,B000E46GGO,5,1196640000,These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.<br /><br />I found them to be very sweet.<br />Makes a great snack or even dessert!
706,B000E46GGO,5,1196640000,"The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."
707,B000E46GGO,5,1194998400,Delicious as breakfast or a snack.<br />I bought these as an alternative to<br />non-organic cereal & milk for breakfast.<br /><br />They were a big hit & I do not have to keep<br />non-organic milk on hand.  I have not been<br />able to find organic powdered milk they will<br />drink.
708,B000E46GGO,4,1193875200,"I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.  These make a great snack.  They are very sweet.  I cannot eat just one which is probably bad.  I think I am going to try the unfrosted variety to see if they are less sweet."
709,B000E46GGO,4,1182902400,Toast it for 1 min. perfect breakfast. I wish it was a little less sweet though.
710,B000E46GGO,2,1181779200,"Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan."
711,B000E46GGO,3,1191196800,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
712,B000E46GGO,2,1258848000,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
713,B000E46GGO,2,1255132800,"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
714,B000E46GGO,1,1328659200,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber...Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!<br /><br />Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Invert, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Palm Oil, Organic Whole Wheat Flour"
715,B000E46GGO,3,1237680000,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
716,B000E46GGO,5,1176508800,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."
717,B000E46GGO,5,1149638400,The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
718,B000E46GGO,5,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry"
719,B000E46GGO,5,1168473600,"These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
720,B000E46GGO,5,1198972800,"First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
721,B000E46GGO,5,1189641600,"I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite."
722,B000E46GGO,5,1164326400,These toaster pastries are very very good.These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts.You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack..
723,B000E46GGO,5,1201910400,"I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND."
724,B000E46GGO,5,1199923200,"These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them ""Purple Flurp"" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too)."
725,B000E46GGO,5,1197244800,"I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry."
726,B000E46GGO,4,1200614400,"Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much..."

728,B000E46GGO,5,1160179200,"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase."
729,B000E46GGO,5,1169942400,"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor."
730,B000E46GGO,4,1187136000,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
731,B000E46GGO,5,1196640000,"I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes."
732,B000E46GGO,4,1193961600,These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!

734,B000E46GGO,5,1160956800,"I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them."
735,B000E46GGO,5,1155513600,"Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!"
736,B000E46GGO,5,1238371200,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door.
737,B000E46GGO,4,1209340800,"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box."

739,B000E46GGO,5,1230422400,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure."
740,B000E46GGO,5,1226534400,i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
741,B000E46GGO,5,1204848000,"Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!"
742,B000E46GGO,5,1202428800,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
743,B000E46GGO,5,1200873600,"One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients."
744,B000E46GGO,4,1189987200,"These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
745,B000E46GGO,3,1181779200,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
746,B000E46GGO,5,1329350400,"Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!"
747,B000E46GGO,5,1283299200,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
748,B000E46GGO,5,1272499200,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
749,B000E46GGO,5,1243209600,"My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard ""pop-tarts"", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement. Well folks here it is, my kids eat them all the time, they make a perfect snack that is not junk. I wish more variety packages were available. I absolutely reccomend this product in all flavors."
750,B000E46GGO,5,1237248000,these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry
751,B000E46GGO,5,1236124800,My wife & mom really like these.  They are really good & replace the breakfast rush meal
752,B000E46GGO,4,1221350400,"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!"
753,B000E46GGO,5,1219190400,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
754,B000E46GGO,5,1215820800,"I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!"
755,B000E46GGO,5,1206921600,"My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."

758,B000E46GGO,5,1182297600,"Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second. Also tasty right out of the package for an on-the-go snack."
759,B000E46GGO,4,1174867200,"a little dry, but given that they're pretty healthy (all things considered), i'm willing to forgive..."
760,B000E46GGO,5,1172102400,"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."

762,B000E46GGO,4,1168646400,It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
763,B000E46GGO,5,1187827200,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run.  They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
764,B000E46GGO,5,1181260800,Recommended.  Good price when bought in bulk.
765,B000E46GGO,5,1177804800,These are delicious! They are much better and much better for you and the planet than more processed alternatives.
766,B000E46GGO,5,1214438400,"These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
767,B000E46GGO,5,1350518400,"Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.

Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon."
768,B000E46GGO,4,1347926400,"We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."
769,B000E46GGO,5,1344556800,"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support."
770,B000E46GGO,5,1343347200,"I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of ""food,"" is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more."
771,B000E46GGO,5,1342310400,"First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a ""healthy"" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation."
772,B000E46GGO,5,1340755200,"What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth."
773,B000E46GGO,5,1337472000,This is a great price for a healthy food for my kids!  Like the convenience of purchasing and scheduling deliveries when needed.
774,B000E46GGO,5,1318982400,"My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat."
775,B000E46GGO,5,1316736000,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
776,B000E46GGO,5,1302134400,I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.  Amazon has a lower price than my local grocers.
777,B000E46GGO,4,1299110400,"I like these, paltry on the frosting! Can see right through it, not just in one spot, all of it."
778,B000E46GGO,5,1298246400,"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
779,B000E46GGO,4,1297814400,"The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly."
780,B000E46GGO,5,1294358400,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
781,B000E46GGO,5,1291939200,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
782,B000E46GGO,5,1288915200,"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"
783,B000E46GGO,5,1284681600,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
784,B000E46GGO,5,1282521600,These are the best toaster pasties we have had. Nature's Path has the best flavors and ingredients and at a good price - a good deal and good for you all around. I purchase them over and over. My husband loves them. Everyone that tries them loves them. And the best part is they are organic too!
785,B000E46GGO,5,1277596800,"Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets."
786,B000E46GGO,4,1276732800,organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.
787,B000E46GGO,3,1275782400,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
788,B000E46GGO,5,1274054400,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
789,B000E46GGO,5,1269993600,"I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or ""pomegran"" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!"
790,B000E46GGO,5,1268438400,"If you like pop tarts these taste great and are ""healthy"" (well as healthy as a sweet, frosted pop tart can get anyway). If you are going to buy pop tarts for your kids, spend the extra money and buy these,"
791,B000E46GGO,5,1267056000,"I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good. Good flavor, nice quick and easy snack."
792,B000E46GGO,5,1265414400,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
793,B000E46GGO,5,1261872000,A good breakfast or snack option for kids on the go- and without all the icky additives.  We all like them!  Buy them with the Subscribe and Save and they are a great deal!
794,B000E46GGO,5,1260835200,These are great.  Loved em.  My only complaint I guess would be the price here.  I bought a 32 count box of these at Costco for only 7.99.  You could buy the same quantity for about half the cost there vs here.
795,B000E46GGO,5,1253577600,"I prefer natural foods with minimal processing, and we are kosher. This is an amazing product. Excellent for any time of the day, good for snacks, or along with breakfast. My kids love them, and I kind of like them too."
796,B000E46GGO,5,1245888000,"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community."
797,B000E46GGO,4,1244505600,I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.
798,B000E46GGO,5,1240012800,"These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up."
799,B000E46GGO,4,1228521600,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
800,B000E46GGO,5,1223251200,Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type. Convenient when they need a quick breakfast or after school snack. We buy the strawberry and blueberry often.
801,B000E46GGO,3,1219622400,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories.  A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
802,B000E46GGO,5,1210377600,My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :)
803,B000E46GGO,4,1208649600,"With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children."
804,B000E46GGO,5,1208131200,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
805,B000E46GGO,3,1202169600,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
806,B0037QGKSK,3,1274313600,"The bar itself was decent and didn't have many calories associated with it. I generally try to avoid snack foods but this fact made it fairly easy for me to grab one or two of between meals.<br /><br />The taste though was semi decent and nothing special. If you don't like the taste of dates I suggest you avoid. At times it tastes like a neutrograin bar and other times it tastes like dates themselves.<br /><br />I also had, on several occasions, the unfortunate experience of getting some of the bar stuck in a tiny hole in my teeth. It's very hard to remove once it's stuck up there I can assure you.<br /><br />It's a decent bar for a quick snack but nothing too special."
807,B0037QGKSK,3,1271289600,"Don't be dissapointed with the look (brown, like a piece of soggy food). It tastes like a real strawberry."

810,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"Seems to be a consensus here with most of the reviewers that this is a decent product. I concur. The nutritional value is high; the flavor is decent, with a good synergy between the strawberry, dates, and oats; and it is vegan and certified organic for those who care about this.<br /><br />Now, here comes the however part ... The product description says that there are two servings per 1.7 oz bar. Now, 1.7 oz = 3 bites. Which means that a serving size is 1 1/2 bites. Just who is it who makes up these standards anyway? This is ludicrous if you ask me. The cost/benefit ratio here is so low as to be ridiculous.<br /><br />So, if price point is not an issue with you, then this would be a fair product. It will be interesting to see what the retail price is set at. THAT could be the product killer."
811,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"This is a very tasty nutrition bar. It has 160 calories, 2 grams of fat, 20 mg of sodium, 3 grams of protein, and 22 grams of sugar. The sugar content, even though it is arguably natural, is very high and would not recommend this with people with sugar problems.<br /><br />The bars are labeled as vegan and contain no trans fat. They are very yummy and have a nice strawberry and dates taste. It is not overpowering but, it is a bit sugary.<br /><br />Now, the issue with these bars is the cost. At twice, and even three times the costs of other bars such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RF5Y"">CLIF ZBaR</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW"">Larabar</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHN956"">Kashi Bars</a> these bars are not a good economical option unless you follow a vegan diet."
812,B0037QGKSK,2,1269388800,"I was really looking forward to trying the Pro Bar fruition Strawberry bars.  I love snack bars and often will have a couple for breakfast. Nutritionally, these bars are great loaded with fruit and fiber and some protein.  They're 100% Vegan and non-GMO. My only problem with the bar is I'm not a big fan of dates and these taste overwhelmingly like dates.  The bars say they are made with organic dates and oats.  The taste of oats is pretty neutral.  I was expecting a bar that tasted like strawberry with some oats and dates along for the ride.  Instead this bar tastes like dates with the strawberry thrown in along for the ride.  Neither of my daughters is a fan of dates.  One wouldn't even try the bars.  The other took one bite and wouldn't eat any more.<br /><br />If you like dates and strawberries, I think you'll love these bars. They're soft and moist.  And, as I said, nutritionally, they are a winner. But, expect a big date flavor."
813,B0037QGKSK,3,1269216000,"I think some of the other reviewers are being a little unkind. To be honest if I had read the reviews before deciding to order I probably would have passed. As it was, I only read the other comments AFTER having tasted the bar. My considered opinion is that as far as healthy energy bars go ""Fruition"" hits the mark. It is a little like the texture and taste of a fig Newton without the soft cookie shell, but it has a very definite strawberry flavor that I personally like. It made a great mid-afternoon snack - though I'm not sure that just one bar would constitute a meal replacement. The main drawback to the product is the price. I'd have to be convinced that there were other tangible health benefits to eating this bar in order to justify the high price at over $2 per bar."
814,B0037QGKSK,2,1269129600,"The fact that that this bar is made of healthy ingredients is good, and, as a snack, is is healthier than a chocolate bar.  It is dense and chewy, which I liked, but I could not detect any rolled oats or cashews.  What I thought were pieces of cashew nuts had no cashew texture.  The whole bar has the same dried-paste texture except for some small seeds, possibly strawberry seeds.  Unfortunately, I did not like the flavor of Fruition Strawberry.  After I took a bite, I thought it was made from fig paste, but the list of ingredients shows date paste, it appears that dates and strawberry together taste similar to figs.  In any regard, if I have not seen the packaging, I would not realize the bar had any strawberry in it.  Furthermore, in my opinion, Fruition Strawberry bars are very sweet.  I consider them high in sugar - 22g per bar (one bar is 160 calories).  I compared a Fruition Strawberry bar to my preferred Nature Valley Trail Mix Fruit and Nut bar, and Trail Mix has only 14g of sugar AND five times less sodium than Fruition.  In addition Fruition Strawberry is quite pricey - the price per bar is four times that of Trail Mix.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Wy wife really likes these bars.  She likes the texture and the flavor, although she agrees that the bar does not taste like strawberry.  She also agrees that the bar is pricey."
815,B0037QGKSK,2,1269043200,"This vegan snack bar contains no trans fat or artificial flavors.  It tastes like a Fig Newton, very dense, chewy, and dry.  It's not sweet enough for me and I probably wouldn't eat one unless I had nothing else.  Recommended for those who want a healthy snack and don't mind bland taste."
816,B0037QGKSK,4,1269302400,"I eat a lot of granola/nutrition/cereal bars, and this bar is a nutritious and OK-tasting alternative to existing products.  Each bar is packed with 160 mostly organic calories, making it more satisfying than most in terms of hunger.<br /><br />In  terms of nutrition, these are mostly organic but otherwise have fairly standard nutrition as far as granola/nutrition bars go: nothing either positive or negative there.<br /><br />My only negative is taste: it tastes good, but not AS good, in my opinion, as a nutri-grain bar. My taste buds aren't tuned to organic foods, though, which is worth mentioning: if yours are, you might vastly prefer the taste of these. Of note: our toddler loves these."
817,B0037QGKSK,5,1269475200,"I love the taste--and especially the texture--of these bars. They're moist and chewy, but not at all sticky or gooey. The texture is almost like a brownie, dense and chewy. And filling! As good as they are, you're not tempted to eat two, because one is satisfying enough.<br /><br />The sweetness comes mainly from fruit sugars, but as I don't have a sweet tooth, it was slightly too much for me. However, I'm assuming that most people have a higher tolerance for sweetness than I do, so they'll probably find the level to be just right.<br /><br />Of all the ""healthy"" bars I've tried, I have to say this one has the healthiest ingredients. And at only 160 calories with no saturated fat, I feel good about eating it, because it's not just a candy bar in disguise like most bars. My niece is used to there only being ""healthy"" food at Auntie's house, but I think this time she won't mind!"
818,B0037QGKSK,2,1278806400,"The name of the bar is ""Fruition"", but really all the fruit in it is just dates. Dates are not a super nutritious high-antioxidant fruit, they're just really sweet. The bar basically has a datey and brown rice syrup taste, with just a hint of mild berry flavoring... it doesn't taste authentic and bright and exciting. Hardly any cranberries! Also, the chias are a little annoying; they get stuck in your teeth after swelling; however, there really isn't that many chia seeds to state a ""superfood"" claim.<br /><br />This bar I thought to try, because it seemed similar to Betty Lou's Just Great Stuff Superberry Acai bar (which I love, and has a great ORAC score), but it really doesn't have the nutrition or flavor that Betty Lou's bars do. It's really too sweet and nothing special. I'd say the best part about it is the packaging--the designing of the film is nice. Based on the beautiful packaging, I was hoping for a great tasting nutritious bar. Not so much. :("
819,B0037QGKSK,4,1269993600,"PRO BAR ""fruition"" snack bars have a robust fruity flavor. The sweetness is a natural compound of strawberry, apple and date. I love the fact that this is a vegan snack that has no cholesterol and very low sodium. One of these bars makes an excellent snack and contains only 160 calories.<br /><br />The one flaw is the texture which is not chewy enough. Everything including the oats and cashew nuts has been ground up fine and the result is a rather gluey texture."
820,B0037QGKSK,2,1274918400,"I was mostly disappointed with these snack bars. The flavor is okay -- definitely heavy on the dates taste -- but I absolutely hated the texture. It feels almost chalky or sandy in your mouth.<br /><br />While it doesn't purport to be organic, some reviewers have already said that this product is ""organic"" and ""natural"". This is not the case. While some organic ingredients are used, the bar is not 100% organic, like other products on the market. This is somewhat deceptive.<br /><br />Bottom line is that there are better tasting bars out there and some of them are true organic."
821,B0037QGKSK,3,1271203200,"I gave one of these to my sixteen-year-old niece, who took a couple of bites and summed it up: ""When you first open it, it smells like you're going to get a tangy strawberry flavor, but when you eat it, it there's hardly any strawberry flavor at all."" After she went home, I found that she took maybe 2 bites and then left the bar on her plate.<br /><br />The first time I ate one, a week or so earlier, the phrase ""hint of strawberry"" came to mind as a better description of the flavor. It should be noted that, in terms of nutrition and ingredients, there is no downside at all (unless you're counting carbs: 34/22 sugars). I've eaten a few of them over the past few weeks. I did not find them nearly as bad as some of the one- and two-star reviewers, but cannot find anything about them that deserves more than three stars."
822,B0037QGKSK,3,1271116800,"I'm a big fan of snack bars, as I often eat them at work when I'm facing late afternoon hunger.  I tried this Fruition Strawberry Bar and had mixed feelings on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Texture.  It reminds me of a Fig Newton's texture.  It's not crumbly, so it won't make a mess (which is a big bonus for snacks on the go).  But it also isn't too gooey and sticky.<br />- Two servings of fruit in each bar.  Since very few people get their full allotment of fruits in a day, this definitely helps.<br />- Four grams of fiber.  Not a huge amount, but again, most people don't hit their fiber target in a given day.<br />- Contains a lot of organic ingredients and is vegan.  Some people may not care about this, but it's very important to others.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- High price.<br />- High sugar (22 grams)<br />- Strawberry flavor is not strong (and it's low on the list of ingredients). The primary ingredient is dates.<br /><br />Mixed feelings:<br />- Taste.  It's not the greatest tasting thing, but it's not bad either.  I don't picture myself ever craving one.  My vegan sister-in-law tried one and thought it was disgusting.<br />- Calories.  It contains 160, which is high or low depending on what your alternative is.  Is it healthier than eating a vending machine candy bar?  Of course.  But it's also higher than eating actual fruit, or a Fiber One bar (which is around 135 calories)."
823,B0037QGKSK,4,1270598400,"Overall I was happy with these bars. They had a decent flavor, moist, relatively filling, relatively healthy, good mouth feel.<br />I was however a bit disappointed with the flavor. I was expecting something to be a bit tart and strawberry but it tasted much closer to a fig newton or dates than anything strawberry I can identify.<br /><br />Ingredients organic date paste, organic rolled oats, and organic brown rice syrup strawberry pur&eacute;e, cashews, apple juice infused strawberries,white and black Chia seeds natural strawberry flavor strawberry extract tocopherols, natural flavor, ascorbic acid, citric acid, arabic gum.<br /><br />I like this bar enough to buy a single unit in the future but not an entire case. If I liked the flavor of dates better I would be much more likely to purchase a case."
824,B0037QGKSK,5,1270166400,"Ugly brown in color, very chewy, not nearly as sweet nor as strongly strawberry flavored as we expected.  But once we ate the first one, what can I say -- we were hooked.  If you like Fig Newtons, you'll love these.  Low fat, low calorie, filling."
825,B0037QGKSK,5,1269993600,"The ingredients list for the probar is pretty marvelous; everything is organic.  The consistency appears to mainly comprise dates, which is fine with me, since dates are delicious.  There is a slight hint of strawberry; the box hypes the addition of a super-food ingredient called a chia seed, but I couldn't see the seeds.  Perhaps they were ground up and added with the rest of the bar.<br /><br />While the bar may appear to be unappetizing, it tastes delicious and wholesome.  The sweetness is perfectly balanced.  The only downside is that each bar costs roughly between $2-$3.  If you absolutely must have your intake of chia seed and it must be in bar form, then you can't go wrong with the probar."
826,B0037QGKSK,4,1269993600,"This bar ranks pretty highly in its genre. I like that it is organic and vegan, and only has 160 calories. It also has 4g of fiber and very low fat, which is great. I didn't expect it to taste like a candy bar or granola bar, but I think it tasted better than others in the same genre, like some soy bars. The strawberry flavor is pretty light, but it's there. I also liked the density and the texture. It's not gooey or dry and doesn't stick in your throat. It was also filling and energizing enough as a snack. I would have ranked this with five stars, but I can't picture myself buying it because it's so expensive for only 12 bars. If it was half the price, I would definitely buy this product."
827,B0037QGKSK,5,1269993600,"This bar is like a healthy fig newton without the outer cookie part. That is the best way for me to describe the taste. This date and oat bar was better than expected. Sometimes these healthy bars are like eating grass, but this one had decent flavor. Also, this was pliable and easy to chew. My six-year-old son loved it and ate a whole one himself! Incidently, being six, he has loose front teeth. As he was eating one, he lost his tooth! We think he swallowed it! Yikes! He enjoyed the bar so much, he never noticed. Give it a try. It would be a great pick-me-up for hiking or snacks for vacation."
828,B0037QGKSK,3,1269907200,"My family and I eat a lot of organic foods, and when I saw these Fruition snack bars, I was excited to try them, and offer them as a healthy alternative when my kids get hungry for a snack.  As with most of the other disappointed reviewers, I am not a fan of the Fruition Probars.  In theory, Probar came up with a great concept for a quick fix bar.  The ingredients list has mostly organic ingredients and foods that are good for you.  Organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, strawberry puree, and chia seeds make up the bulk of the bar.  There are very few fillers or chemical ingredients added--things that I am trying to avoid in food products.  These would make an ideal snack, except the taste and texture of these bars is pretty unappealing, and despite the fact that these are healthy for you, it keeps me from wanting to eat them.<br /><br />As other reviews have pointed out, there is very little strawberry in the bar, and the overriding taste is date and mashed oats.  The bars themselves resemble a suet when you open the wrapper, and the texture in your mouth is like sticky, slightly hardened, pasty oatmeal.  The bars may be healthy, but the experience of eating the bars leave a lot to be desired.  They are visually unappealing, as my nine year old pointed out (and thus refused to try) and the texture in your mouth is not all that great either.  If you are using the bar as a meal replacement, or for a quick snack, you will be left wanting for something else, including a giant glass of water to wash it all down.  I think that Probar is on to something in trying to create a healthy organic snack bar alternative to what is on the market, they just need to figure out how to make it taste (and look) better.  I give the ingredients 4 stars and the taste of the bars 2 stars."
829,B0037QGKSK,1,1269907200,"Confessedly I rarely to never eat health food (certainly not if it can be avoided), so the Fruitation strawberry bar met every one of my stereotype expectations: awkward taste, terrible consistency, and wholly unfulfilling.<br /><br />Light on strawberry and heavy on... dates, barley, and other unpallatables, this bar doesn't really deliver on its flavor promise.  Much worse though, it has the consistency of instant oatmeal that's been left out for 2 or 3 hours, then shaped into a bar - soggy and moist-ish, providing enough solid substance to chew against, but barely.<br /><br />I do give the bar props for the whole no-gluten, no-sugar thing, and again my view could be wildly skewed by my virgin innocence to health food stuffs.  For me, trying the Fruitation bar was a less-than-pleasant experience I shan't repeat."
830,B0037QGKSK,3,1269820800,"I received the ProBar Fruition Bar in Strawberry flavor; the label said it's made with organic dates and oats. Each bar has 160 calories, 2 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber, 22 grams of sugar and 3 grams of protein.<br /><br />The bar is 1.7oz, so pretty small, but I found that eating just one was satisfying enough. (I loved the wrapper - it just looked very fresh - but that's irrelevant) The ingredients were pretty straight forward with no confusing chemicals. Even though the bar was supposed to have a strawberry flavor, I could taste more of the dates and any strawberry flavor seemed artificial despite the fresh strawberry puree ingredient.<br /><br />The bar does not look very appetizing, but the taste is OK. Compared to many other nutrition bars out there, it wasn't overly chewy and did not leave a cardboard taste in my mouth. However, I think that 160 calories and ESPECIALLY the 22 grams of sugar is a little much for a tiny bar. If those 2 factors were balanced by more fiber and protein, I'd feel better about eating it. If you follow Weight Watchers, each bar is 3 points."
831,B0037QGKSK,3,1269648000,"These bars have a pleasant strawberry smell, but little strawberry flavor.  Nor do they seem to have much strawberry in them.  I suspect the claim to their having two servings of fruit is based on the main ingredient, date paste.<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, I prefer to have quantifiable nutrition in what I eat.  These bars contain no recognized vitamins whatsoever and small portions of only two minerals.  I suspect this is because the primary ingredient is fruit sugars.  On the plus side they do contain a lot of fiber and highly touted Chia seeds, which can't hurt.<br /><br />The taste was not bad at all, but I do't recommend eating it without something to wash it down.  I also did not find it very filling, despite all that fiber."
832,B0037QGKSK,4,1269561600,"These dense, moist bars made mostly of date paste aren't pretty, but they offer a relatively healthy alternative as an on-the-go meal supplement or breakfast.  The bars are chewy, with a bit of seed crunch from black and white chia seeds.  They taste more of dates than strawberries; strawberry puree is fourth on the ingredient list, after date paste, rolled oats, and brown rice syrup. The cloying sweetness of dates simply overwhelms the berry flavor, although the strawberry taste and scent are there.  For me, that isn't a bad thing -- I like dates -- but people expecting a fresh, dominant strawberry taste will be disappointed.  The cashews cannot be easily detected in the flavor, either, although they add to the protein.<br /><br />With 22 grams of sugar, the bars aren't a good choice for people trying to limit sugar intake, although the modest 2 grams of fat (no saturated or trans fat) works for those who are on fat-restricted diets.  The primary nutritional benefit of the Fruition bars comes from the fiber (4 grams) and protein (3 grams), with antioxidants from the fruit, nuts, and whole grain oats.  They contain no vitamins and only a small amount of minerals (4% RDA of calcium and 6% RDA of iron.)  In fact, the complete absence of vitamin C suggests just how few strawberries each bar contains.<br /><br />Because these are vegan, they contain no dairy products -- no eggs, no milk, no butter, no whey.  They are the organic counterpart of the usual meal and sports bars, both in taste and texture.  If you don't like dense and chewy sports bars, you won't like these, but if you do and like the taste of dates, try these out.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
833,B0037QGKSK,4,1269475200,"there is a lot of sugar but mostly healthy ingredient but best of all, my three year old loves these healthy snacks. They have the consistence of a date bar, and since it is basically a date paste, that makes sense.  They are not ""too"" sweet, even though they have 22g of sugar. I think they are tasty, especially with a cup of coffee and are way better for you than a donut, at and 130 cal. a lot less fattening. They are pretty good size for a fruit bar and filling. I'd buy them again and recommend them."
834,B0037QGKSK,1,1269561600,This is my first 1 star review.....I can't believe I'm writing it.<br /><br />I wanted to like this bar.  But I couldn't. The texture of the bar is repulsive and there's very little real flavor.  The idea of an organic strawberry bar really appealed to me.  Until I took a big ol' bite of this bar...can you say gag reflex?<br /><br />Organic foods can taste good....this one doesn't. Pass on the ProBar Fruition.
835,B0037QGKSK,3,1269561600,"Organic, natural foods should taste great and be satisfying. While these bars are very healthy for you, they taste too grainy and heavy. Eating them makes one happy for trying to eat healthy foods, but they honestly do not taste that great and it's a bit of a chore to finish even one bar. I wish that there was more fruit flavor in the bars because the fiber taste seems to overtake the fruit flavor."
836,B0037QGKSK,3,1269475200,"After opening the package, I was surprised the unappetizing product was even edible. It's a dark mass of gooey nuts, oats, dates, strawberries and etc. Surprisingly enough the gooey product didn't adhere to your teeth and make you crave brushing your teeth right away.<br /><br />Tastewise, it was edible and kind of sweet, but it's not something I would pick up normally and eat as a snake. The only time I would eat such a snack would be if I had no other food and was hungry. The 160 calorie per bar is great, but I couldn't get much strawberry taste from it. The date taste was overpowering and does remind me of the fig newton bars.<br /><br />Both my husband and my 6 year old tried the bar, but immediately after taking a bite their faces cringed. While they could swallow it, they did not enjoy the taste whatsover.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to others who are extremely food conscious and can take the expense of these snacks. Otherwise, I'd prefer eating fresh fruit over this product."
837,B0037QGKSK,3,1269475200,"Ok, first I have to say that I do not buy many organic food products, my guess is that my taste buds are not as used to this kind of food as other reviewers.<br /><br />I opened the package and as soon as I did, I had my three kids sorrounding me with their hands trying to reach the box, so I gave them each one, my oldest son opened his first, he took a bite and immediately gave it back to me, he said ""it tastes funny"" I told my other son to try it before he opened his just to see if he liked it, he tried it and gave me his unopened bar back to me, he said ""it does taste weird!"" Yeah you guessed it, my daughter didn't like it either!.. Ok, so I thought it was just the kids, ""they're not into the grown up stuff!"" I took a bite and I knew what they were talking about! It tastes like some kind of flavorless hard Jelly, It does not taste like strawberry at all to me (although you can feel the seeds!) In my own opinion, if you've never tried this kind of organic food, you probably won't like it. And just to be fair, I did give one to one of my co-workers since he only eats organic food and he loved it, he even asked me where I bought them.<br /><br />At this price (around $2.25 per bar) I think you can probably find something more nutritious and with better taste, but that's just me."
838,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"Very healthy and they taste good but the cost exceeds what I would pay<br /><br />A single 1.7 oz Fruition Strawberry bar is the equivalent of eating two servings of fruit. These bars are made of strawberry, dates, oats, chia seeds and cashews. The bar is very filling for the size and it serves as a good appetite suppressant. Each bar contains 160 calories, 4 grams of fiber, 2 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein and 4 grams of dietary fiber. However it also contains 22 grams of sugar and 34 grams of carbohydrates which seems to be a little high. The chia seeds make these bars rich in antioxidants and omega-3. These bars are 100 Vegan, Non GMO and certified organic by QAI.<br /><br />**These bars are made in made in a facility that processes nuts and they contain nuts**<br /><br />I have to admit I was skeptical when first opening the package and they don't look incredibly appetizing but they taste much better than they look. You will immediately smell the strawberry but thy do not have a strong strawberry taste. The closest thing I can compare these bars to is original fig newton bars. They really taste quite a bit like them. I let my kids try one and they both liked them a lot. I liked them but the cost is beyond what I would pay for them. The cost of these bars is about 5 to 6 times the cost of granola or cereal bars and I just can't justify that. I think these bars are a good option and they have their place but it's not something that I will be purchasing on a regular basis. It you are totally committed to a 100 Vegan diet and cost isn't a deciding factor for you then you may feel differently than I do."
839,B0037QGKSK,3,1269216000,"The PROBAR Fruition bar is probably healthier than a lot of other bars or snacks on the market.  The strawberry flavor was not very prominent, and the bar has a bit of an apple flavor. I didn't think that it tasted bad and will continue to eat them.

840,B0037QGKSK,3,1327536000,"Since my brother is very into healthy and nutritious food, I gave him a box of these to test and taste. He said:<br />""These are excellent as a meal replacement or snack. The organic ingredient composition combined with the great fruit taste and chewy texture make it the healthy choice for exercise and outdoor activities. Only main downside is the regular price, which is roughly double the cost of competitors.""<br /><br />I had a couple, they do indeed taste good, not too try like some other energy bars, and not too crunchy where it'll break your teeth! You can taste the strawberries inside and it's pretty decent for a snack too. Interesting that there's ""unprocessed dates, oats, and cashews"" inside, I wouldn't have noticed the dates and I'm not a big fan of those.  Not sure if I felt ""full of energy from dawn until dusk"" after eating these, but I'm sure it'll work for some!"
841,B0037QGKSK,5,1319155200,"New ""PROBAR Fruition Snack Bars"" come in a variety of fruit flavors and provide a tasty quick energy kick on the trail, based on an intriguing mixture of high energy dates, rolled oats, and fruit.  At 160 calories per bar, a snack doesn't have to wreck a diet, and the fruit flavors, especially the Lemon, Cherry, and Strawberry, really stand out strongly.  The bars are a bit pricey per unit, which might be a good motivation to buy in the quantity offered by a 12-count box.  The bars seem to hold up well in rucksacks and pockets, although they need to kept above freezing to be chewable.  Highly recommended."
842,B0037QGKSK,4,1319068800,"These are not soft like I expected-they are NOT a variation of the ""cereal bars"" which are so soft you don't even need teeth to chew them. Rather these are small, but HEAVY, and oddly, imperfectly shaped,and kind of hard. Like sweet little bricks. In reality, after I got used to the consistency I quite enjoyed them, especially as I am getting tired of the regular cereal bars the major  supermarkets carry."
843,B0037QGKSK,2,1296691200,"I wanted to like these...  One bite and I couldn't go any further--reminded me of damp sawdust with some gravel bits.  The texture was what I could not get past, despite loving Larabars, Bumblebars, and Kind bars, these fell no where in that range of textures.  I put the rest of the box out in the company break room and solicited other opinions.  ""Tastes like strawberry scented cardboard."" ""Nasty."" ""Not my cup of tea.""  Most were too polite to say what they were thinking other than ""eh"", but the mid-chew face, eyes darting for a trash can, panicky look that someone would watch them spit it out, were all the review I needed.  I didn't hear much else out of a group of folks who will eat just about anything, and Fruition bars lingered on the table for several days."
844,B0037QGKSK,4,1280966400,"I have become a fan of LaraBars, and their single-digit number of ingredients, and was expecting the ProBar to be similar. It is and it isn't.<br /><br />I'm comparing specifically the Strawberry ProBar Fruition to the Cherry Pie LaraBar, as that's the most similar kind of LaraBar I've tried.<br /><br />Having tried the two side by side, I suddenly realize that the LaraBar is like a fruitcake, only a really, really good one oozing with tart cherries and nuts. The ProBar reminds me of a Fig Newton. There's not the outside crust, but a bite of the ProBar is very reminiscent of a bite of Fig Newton to me. Including the texture with the tiny seeds. This is almost certainly because the second ingredient in the ProBar is rolled oats -- the cakey flavor (the LaraBar has no grain).<br /><br />The ProBar also seems sweeter to me, which I don't like, and I guess at 34 carbs to the LaraBar's 30, it IS slightly sweeter.<br /><br />They are both 1.7oz, FWIW.<br /><br />The LaraBar has more calories (200) than the ProBar (160), and 8 grams of fat to the 2 grams of fat in the ProBar. So that's something to consider, depending on why you are contemplating this purchase.<br /><br />For me, the whole-foods aspect of LaraBars was one of the draws, and I prefer that to these. But depending on your needs, these might fill the bill. More like a cookie to me, but very tasty."
845,B0037QGKSK,4,1276905600,"We enjoyed these bars - the date content isn't overpowering, but keep it in mind in case you don't like dates.  Bars were filling without causing the heavy sensation in the stomach."
846,B0037QGKSK,5,1276732800,I can't keep enough of these in the house.  They seem to love them and I do too.  Sweet but not too sugary sweet.  They are moist so they don't leave you parched.  You can grab on on the run and not have to worry about grabing something to wash them down.
847,B0037QGKSK,3,1276560000,I enjoyed this snack bar a bit. It did make me super thirsty afterwards but it tasted like it should. It reminds me a bit of other types of cereal bars so it is just OK. Nothing that stands out too much but just that it's healthy and tastes pretty much like all the other bars.
848,B0037QGKSK,5,1274918400,"These little bars taste fantastic, and they have tons of great stuff in them.  Nothing unhealthy like high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />All truly Natural, and all truly Yummy!"
849,B0037QGKSK,4,1274313600,Basically this bar tastes like a fig newton without the pastry outer layer. That's what it reminded me of.<br />I guess if you are craving something sweet and nutritious this might be the way to go. I wasn't excited by it.<br />The strawberry taste was good though. I'm not into fruit bars much but I can't fault this product. It is everything it is trying to be.
850,B0037QGKSK,5,1273622400,"This is the favorite ""bar"" in my house.  My kids gobbled them up.  I've bought lots of fruit nutition bars and this is my kids' favorite.  Glad to see nutrition bars being eaten, rather than sitting around getting old, like so many bars I buy for my kids.  Great food to take on car trips, etc.  Better than stopping at a fast food restaurant."
851,B0037QGKSK,3,1272153600,"I had initially been really anticipating the arrival of these bars in order to see just how they compared to my snack bar standby, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6"">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, well I have to admit that now that they have arrived, I am a bit disappointed. For one, they are 160 calories per bar where my Nutri-Grain bars are at 130 calories per bar. Also, I think that the Nutri-Grain bars are better tasting than these ones, which I found to have very little strawberry taste to them at all. More of a faint hint of strawberries, rather than actually tasting like strawberries.<br /><br />I don't think these are bad snack bars at all, I just feel that Nutri-Grain are much better with more flavor and less calories.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Martial Artist/Krav Maga Instructor<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series."

More of a mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />Nothing odd in these, just natural ingrediants.<br /><br />... and they're 3 WW points, just so you know.<br /><br />GREAT for eating while running"
854,B0037QGKSK,4,1271808000,"These bars are pretty darned good - which is to say better than I thought they'd be and better than my first impression. First impression upon opening a bar was - um, they look dark and gritty and not too tasty. And, ok, they are are dark and a little gritty. Then again, they're tasty, too. They enough to take the hunger away and I like the fact that they're organic - a big plus.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy them again. Much better tasting than a lot of the fiber bars you can find - these actually have fruit taste to them - and just enough to satisfy you until the next meal."
855,B0037QGKSK,5,1271635200,"I am on a constant lookout for breakfast bars or snack bars for myself.  Every morning, I have a banana and a bar of some sort.  I was very excited that I got to try these.  They are good but it reminds me of a fig newton type product.  I am not a big fan of the fig newton because of the taste and texture but I can eat them.  This product reminds me of that, with a strawberry flavor.  I had one every day and they do fill you up and I did feel I had ""good"" energy.  I would buy them in a store as a change of pace.  As I said, I do go on searches for the perfect breakfast bar, and since I haven't found one yet, I do alternate among my favorites.  I could see myself buying this about every 3 months or so.<br />It's good and if you like the fig newton thing, you will love it !"
856,B0037QGKSK,4,1271548800,"I guess when I think of superfood, I think of sprulina. These bars did not have much strawberry flavor, but then again, it also did not have the artificial flavor that you would expect from other snack products. You would taste much more strawberry flavor in fresh strawberries. We recieved a whole box, which was much better getting one or two and so I was able to share with the family and got favorable feedback from all.<br /><br />My family loved it much more than I thought they would --- I like to have them with my coffe in the morning as I get up much earlier than the family and I need something to eat before breakfast and this helps to have something good in my stomach. They are also not chewy and gooey like some energy bars are.<br /><br />They are also good for a snack before going to the gym, if you need a little extra energy (as I do). But don't expect an overpowering strawberry flavor."
857,B0037QGKSK,4,1271289600,"Forget the candy bar, and don't worry about trying to pack fresh fruit in your knapsack.  the Fruition Strawberry bars are tasty, satisfying, more convenient and at least as healthy as the fresh stuff.<br /><br />I like it's collection of grains, nuts and fruit that DO NOT try to masquerade as something else.  This is a good tasting snack, it's not a meal substitute and nothing incurs my dietary ire more than the implication that you'll get ""everything you need"" in one meal bar etc.  I would categorize Fruition as a healthy snack, and one that is far more appealing than the empty calories of a carb and sugar-loaded candy bar."
858,B0037QGKSK,5,1271289600,"Tastes amazing, good for you, small, 170 or so calories.<br /><br />You can eat this on the go or at home for a morning snack or at work in between meals.<br /><br />Perfect in every way, and organic!<br /><br />The only ""con"" i have is the price, it's almost 2 dollars a bar, which is kinda high for buying in bulk (it is a small bar after all).<br /><br />The organic protein bars I usually use contain almost twice the calories, are still raw and organic (though not as good tasting as this strawberry bar), comes in at about the same price.  It can be used as a meal replacement, which makes it worth the value.<br /><br />If amazon could offer this as a subscribe and save option and get the price down to 16-18 dollars, I would highly recommend this, and subscribe to get new ones delivered to my house twice a month.<br /><br />These things are AMAZING"
859,B0037QGKSK,3,1271289600,"While I admire the ambitious effort to make a raw food snack that includes a vast array of additional nutrients, this just didn't do it for me.  I wish I could recommend something else that is better, but I'm new to the world of raw foods and found this to be bland and just a tad ""chalky"".  The texture is somewhat moist and chewy, but leaves a dry feeling in the mouth after chewing for a while (and you will have to chew for a while).  My husband thought it was ""okay"" but it didn't leave him asking for more, and my kids were not impressed, either.<br /><br />I do give it 3 stars because it's very healthy and you really can taste the strawberries in this. It's not a hint of strawberry, but has a good, fruity flavor. However, it also has a strong, oat-ey flavor, as well, making it taste somewhat like a stick bar of dry breakfast oatmeal, if you could imagine that.  If you like your foods a little on the milder side with few seasonings, this may actually be appropriate for you. If you're like me and prefer something strong and flavorful, this probably won't float your boat."
860,B0037QGKSK,5,1271289600,"I really dont understand why people dont like these bars.<br /><br />It has organic dates, oats, chia seeds and cashews which is a great combination.<br /><br />I think its a little less sweet for most peoples liking plus .It is soft and love the strawberry seeds mixed with dates texture.<br /><br />My husband and child are more into junk food so i knew they would not appreciate it.<br /><br />I am still hoping this grows on my son ..coz its is seriously healthy...and would work great for lunch boxes.<br /><br />I think its not the typical commercial junk thats really tasty with no nutrition...but its very nutritious with a little less taste.<br /><br />All in all i would say 5 out of 5<br /><br />Update<br /><br />I love these bars ...I think these are a great snack bars in between meals and I really am stuck on these..."
861,B0037QGKSK,4,1271289600,"These are among the better tasting ""nutritious"" snack food bars on the market.  Upon my first bite, my taste buds were almost overwhelmed by date flavor.  Looking over the ingredients, it was no surprise to see that the main ingredient was date paste.  The strawberry taste was apparent, but it was more of a strawberry finish than direct flavor.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, there aren't a whole lot of protein or vitamins in this bar.  Make no mistake, this is no power bar or cliff bar.  What it lacks in those areas, however, it makes up for in flavor and fiber.<br /><br />I'd definitely order these again; they're great on the go, and make a good healthy dessert alternative."
862,B0037QGKSK,5,1271289600,"Since I am a health and fitness nut, eating the best protein bars is in my<br />top list of priorities. As a first-time Fruition patron, I can honestly say<br />the bar was quite satisfactory. I was happy with all nutritional content;<br />however, I was a little disappointed with the number of carbohydrates<br />included in the bar. Carbs are always good, especially after an intensive<br />cardio workout, and especially if complex, but I am always picky about the<br />number of carbs in any nutrition bar; therefore, that somewhat bothered me<br />(and yes, I am aware that many of the best protein/energy bars do include a<br />high number of ""good"" carbs; however, the carb factor is something I have to<br />accept). Aside the carb factor, I was happy with all other nutritional<br />aspects of the bar, such as the bar only being 160 calories (considering its<br />size!), the bar including two servings of fruit, the bar having 4 grams of<br />dietary fiber, and the bar being organic and high fructose corn<br />syrup-less!!!! The taste of the bar was not the best I have tasted, but it<br />was tasty nonetheless. In fact, my three year old-toddler, has favored this<br />strawberry-flavored bar as his current favorite snack food, which suits me<br />well, because he is a thin child, and if these bars please and nourish him,<br />I have no complaints. Buying the bars in bulk is probably a better choice,<br />because it is certainly more cost effective. ""Great bars worth the price"" is<br />certainly my review."
863,B0037QGKSK,4,1271289600,"I love the idea of snack bars, but have never really found any I like. This one is different!<br /><br />The flavors are clean -- it tastes like real food -- and the consistency is completely edible. It does get stuck in your teeth a bit, but not in that cement-like way that many of the others do.<br /><br />The ingredients are great: Organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, strawberry puree, cashews, apple juice infused strawberries, white chia seeds, black chia seeds, natural strawberry flavor, strawberry extract, tocopherols [doesn't note origin], natural flavor, ascorbic acid, citric acid, arabic gum.<br /><br />They're also 100% vegan, and labeled as non-GMO.<br /><br />They have 160 calories per bar, and 34g of carbs (4g of dietary fiber). Only 2g of fat. I think I'd prefer a bar with more calories, fiber, and maybe even fat (I'm not eating a snack bar to lose weight, I'm eating it to keep going without stopping for a full meal), but this is enough to tide me over for an hour or two. With other energy bars, when my body uses it up, I *crash*, and feel so hungry I think I might be sick. With these, it feels more like a naturally-occurring hunger, and I have sufficient time once I realize I'm getting hungry to actually procure some ""real"" food.<br /><br />All in all, these are a great option if you're looking for a snack bar, even if the natural/organic thing isn't the primary thing you're interested in!"
864,B0037QGKSK,3,1271203200,"I really wanted to like these.  I often carry another ""all-natural"" fruit/nut bar (Larabar, usually cherry flavor) to tide me over on my weekly commute to/from ""the city"" for rehearsals, and figured these fruition bars would be a nice flavorful alternative.<br /><br />Sorry, but it just didn't work out.  These have a somewhat ""pasty"" texture, and a very strong flavor of dates, which is OK, I suppose.  After all, the first ingredient listed is ""organic date paste.""  I would emphasize the ""paste"" part of that.  What's really missing is the STRAWBERRY.  I could almost forgive the texture if these had more strawberry flavor.<br /><br />As it is, these are super sweet, with a rather off-putting gummy-pasty texture, and the overriding flavor of dates.  I just can't give these more than three stars."
865,B0037QGKSK,4,1271116800,"While I usually eat granola bars for a quick snack, they're not especially good for you nutritionally.<br /><br />I decided to try something different and went with the Fruition Strawberry bar.<br /><br />They're 160 calories with 20 calories from fat. They have very low sodium and are vegan to boot.<br /><br />I like the taste a lot, it has a definite fruity taste and isn't sickeningly sweet or cloying like some of the granola bars I've had in the past. The texture is soft and moist and won't leave a ton on crumbs in your lap as you snack. I like nibbling a bit as I drink my tea.<br /><br />Since they're soft and moist, they stand up to being in a jacket pocket or a backpack and won't disintegrate into a pile of crumbs as you hike.<br /><br />One warning: they're more likely to appeal to the adult palate, both of my kids vastly prefer the sweet granola snack bars. Don't be disappointed if your kids aren't enamored with them.<br /><br />Bottom line: tasty, good for you and hiking friendly."
866,B0037QGKSK,3,1271116800,"Very unappealing bar, the taste isn't the worst but the aftertaste brings you back for more.  If you can get past the inital look and first bite, you'll enjoy it.  Definitly a nice source of a healthy snack."
867,B0037QGKSK,4,1271030400,"I like the natural fruity flavor.  It's not overly sweet, but it's not cardboard.  And the thick, chewy texture is fine with me.  I find these bars rather filling for their size.  Although they have 160 calories, only 30 come from fat.  Fruition bars seem to have everything going for them.  So what's not to love?<br /><br />Well, there is one thing -- as of this writing, a box of 12 bars runs nearly thirty dollars!  Even other organic fruit bars can be had for less than half that much.  I'm not sure what makes Fruition bars so pricey.  But I can't imagine paying that much for a dozen fruit bars."
868,B0037QGKSK,4,1271030400,"The Probar fruition strawberry snack bar is very good.  I especially like the ingredients of dates(one of my favorites), oats, and strawberries, all mixed together to form a tasty, fruity concoction.  They remind me of Fig Newton cookies(another fave!).  It would be interesting to try any other flavors that Probar makes.  Being organic, and Vegan, the snack bar would appeal to a number of people who are looking for a healthy go-to snack.  I don't know much about the Chia seeds, but think that they are similar to flax, in their usage.  All the other ingredients seem to be natural, and not harmful.  I only gave the bars 4 stars because they are a little too chewy and gummy.  I would have preferred a slightly drier bar - I'm sure the culprit is the dates(which I do adore!).  They are a deliciously fine product when you crave a quick healthy snack!"
869,B0037QGKSK,3,1271030400,"The fruition bars, like most ""superfood"" bars, are not the most tasty things to eat. This being said, they are definitely moister than many. In fact, they almost seem like shaped goo/paste (which makes sense considering the main ingredient). It's almost as if they are uncooked (which they very well may be).<br /><br />Taste aside, the bars are definitely filling and do not make me gag in the same way that other, more drier/powederier  bars do. I will definitely be eating the rest of the box, but once they're gone, I think I'll choose something else, especially considering the $2.00+ per unit price."
870,B0037QGKSK,5,1270944000,"I eat a lot of these types of snack/meal bars.  This one gets high marks from me because of several reasons.  First, the texture is good.  I like that it isn't crumbly or hard, it is soft and chewy without being too gooey.  I'm not a fan of cracking my teeth trying to eat a bar.  One thing I would recommend to try to improve is to make the packaging easier to open.  Sometimes it's easy to open, and sometimes not.  I tried for over a minute to get into this bar the other day because I was sitting in the car, and I didn't have scissors with me. Another plus with this bar is that it should hold up well in the heat.  It hasn't been hot enough (yet) here in South Texas, but in a few months, it is going to be too hot to be traveling around with chocolate coated snack bars.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, you can't go wrong with everything that is in this bar, unless you have allergies to any of it.  Always read through the ingredient list just in case.  I understand that the chia seeds (white and black here) are good for filling you up, and taking away that hungry feeling.  Lots of Omega-3 fatty acids with the chia seeds, antioxidants are a good thing.  The strawberry bar contains 160 calories, has 3 grams of protein, no saturated fat, and 2 grams of total fat.  It includes 4 grams of dietary fiber, which is something we could all use more of.<br /><br />I would say that a bummer about these bars is they are pretty pricey.  I'm not saying that it's not worth it, but any bar that costs more than $2 is expensive."
871,B0037QGKSK,1,1270598400,"Upon first glance at the bar, I was a little afraid to taste it. This small, dense bar is stuffed full of all kinds of healthy fruits, nuts, and seeds. The bar is a little too sweet for my taste, so I was only able to eat half of it. Some people may not like it's soft, dense texture, but you might get used to it after a couple bites."
872,B0037QGKSK,3,1270512000,"Upon opening the package, this snack bar left a mixed first impression.  Visually, the bars are hardly the most visually appealing product I've had, but the strong strawberry smell did promise a tasty snack.  Unfortunately, the promised flavor was never realized.  The texture and flavor of these bars is probably most similar to the filling of a Fig Newton.  While that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it wasn't quite what I was expecting from a snack bar that was labeled as being strawberry flavored.<br /><br />While these snack bars are probably relatively healthy for you (they have NO high-fructose corn syrup listed on the ingredients, and precious little in the way of other sweeteners), they are very expensive.  At more than $2.25 per bar, only the most dedicated vegan or organic food consumer is likely to be willing to buy these.  Personally, I'm not convinced that these are worth the price."
873,B0037QGKSK,4,1270425600,"I really like this snack bar. I did not really taste the strawberry but the taste and texture was very good. I use it as a breakfast bar. It is very filling and not sweet, it tastes very like a breakfast bar I used to buy from a weight loss program I belonged to.I have been eating one with a cup of coffee in the morning and I am not hungry for about 4 hours. It feels good to have something tasty and handy in the morning to get you going, no fuss, no muss, no bother. I am sold on the Probar Fruition Superfood Snack Bar."
874,B0037QGKSK,4,1270166400,"Probar Fruition bar is a healthy, tasty snack.  It is a bit heavy for my taste and high in the calories for someone wanting a health bar while restricting calories.  Overall, though, I would recommend it."
875,B0037QGKSK,5,1270080000,"When I think of an energy bar/supplement bar/etc... I think of a lumpy tasteless cardboard-like experience.  This was not the case with these delicious snacks.<br /><br />The snacks are organic, tasty, have a nice texture, are well-priced, and above all, they're nutritious.  I'd recommend one as a snack.  One ""negative"" comment: for many, the appearance of their food is just as important as the taste and nutritional value ... if you are this type of person, you will likely not find this food appealing."
876,B0037QGKSK,5,1269820800,"not dry, tasty, flavorful but not strong, not grainy, not sticky or tacky, no powdery dry tastless aftertaste as with some nutrition bars.  I found them enjoyable to eat and get nutrition too."
877,B0037QGKSK,3,1269820800,"I received these bars as a promotion, so that I might try and review them. After about a week of having one each morning and taking a few into work for light ""on the go"" snacks, I grew to like them. Chewy, decent (but not overpowering) fruit flavor and filling. That is when I decided I might buy some of these to incorporate into my breakfast routine.<br /><br />After seeing the price, I can confidently say that as good as these bars are, I will not be buying them. They are simply overpriced. The taste is decent (though I agree with another reviewer that there is way more fig than strawberry), the taste is not outstanding or significantly better than the run-of-the-mill breakfast bars at your local grocery (the kind which are half as expensive). As each bar is 160 calories and 1.7 ounces, the bars are simply too small to pay the per-bar price (do the math and I think you'll agree; better yet, calculate a per-ounce price with 12 bars per package and you'll REALLY see what I mean). Yes, these are 'vegan' bars but unless you are vegan (I am not) and cannot find a lower-priced alternative, I'd say that these bars are priced higher than they are worth.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying that these aren't good bars. They have a nice chewy texture, are decently sweet without being sugary, and are a filling quick breakfast or mid-afternoon snack. I simply think it is a shame that they are priced so high. If they were priced lower, I'd have given these five stars."
878,B0037QGKSK,5,1269820800,"As a weight loss coach and foodie who concentrates on natural foods, I tend to shy away from most snack bars, energy bars or protein bars no matter how ""nutritious"" they claim to be...because I am a label reader.<br /><br />Many have as many calories as a full meal or contain things like high fructose corn syrup, or other things to mask the taste of vitamins added or artificial ingredients.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, are  made with organic dates and oats, and packed with antioxidant-rich ""superfoods"" and low calories and fat.  Making them both a great meal replacement or snack bar. They are EXTREMELY filling...high fiber foods are slow to digest so it's very satisfying yet low in fat. (160 calories, 2 grams fat, 4 grams fiber)<br /><br />The texture is similar to a fig newton bar, and the taste is kind of a combo of a fig newton bar, apple juice, strawberry puree, a bit of cashews and oats. Probably because it contains all of the above (except there is date paste rather than fig...not much difference.)<br /><br />They are healthy and satisfying...making them a great treat.<br /><br />Negatives: For me, I wish they were a tad LESS sweet. I'd prefer to taste more oats and less of the natural sweeteners but that is simply personal preference. There is no sugar on the ingredient list but it's sweetened with the strawberry puree, brown rice syrup, and apple juice.  An adjustment of more strawberry paste to less brown rice syrup would probably create a better balance of flavors for me as well even if the sweetness wasn't adjusted because the brown rice syrup creates a sugar taste vs. a fruit taste.<br /><br />This would be a great breakfast due to it's low calorie content yet filling nature and ability to ""grab and go"" with the bar on a busy morning."
879,B0037QGKSK,4,1269820800,"I really appreciate what they are trying to do with this bar.  I applaud anything that uses real foods and minimizes chemicals and unhealthy ingredients and tastes fairly good.  These bars are all that.  However, they are very expensive and they appear to be copying the popular lara bars.  For less money, lara bars are more nutritious and taste better.  If there were nothing to compete with this product, I would recommend it completely.  Unfortunately, there is a better product for less money."
880,B0037QGKSK,3,1269734400,"fruition claims their bar is a ""fruit-based superfood snack bar designed to be satisfying while on the go without added fat and calories."" Each bar is 160 calories and contains 2 grams of total fat and 34 grams of total carbohydrates. When I first open a package it has a strong strawberry smell but does not have the taste to match it even though strawberry puree is the fourth ingredient and there are three other strawberry ingredients as you go down the list. The ingredients are all bound by a date paste that bind them all together and give it its chewy texture and its grittiness I think is attributed by the cashews and chia seeds. It may be all organic but of 39 grams the bar consist of 22 grams of sugar and 20 milligrams of sodium.<br /><br />I must agree with many that it does not taste like strawberries and it does leave an after taste that to me is more nut flavor. A single bar does take away the hunger pangs and left me feeling satisfied. I would eat these but would not seek them out. One aside; I find it funny that of all the fruit flavors fruition sells they do not have a date flavored one as that is the main ingredient of the bar. Of course I have not had a good tasting date since I returned from the Middle East."
881,B0037QGKSK,4,1269734400,"I wasn't aware of Fruition Probars until I tried the new strawberry flavor.  I expected a hard-to-chew granola type bar (I hate granola snacks).  I thought I would hand them over to my husband and use him as a Guiney pig.  But as soon as I opened one I could smell strawberry and dates -- yummy.... I found the bar firm, but soft to chew. It really is tasty, and I appreciate that it's natural, low in calories, etc... We tried the bars when hunger hit and stopping to eat wasn't an option. Just one probar took the hunger away.  My husband's job is physically demanding. This power snack made such an impression on him he wants to try the other flavors.  I highly recommend the new Strawberry Probar."
882,B0037QGKSK,2,1269734400,"These bars are horrible.<br /><br />They have the texture of wet particle board, just like sawdust and chalk.  Makes me think they ground everything to fine powder and mashed it all back together.  The whole thing would've been better if they left the cashews whole and crunchy, the dried strawberries whole and chewy, and the oats whole and crunchy too.<br /><br />A strong strawberry flavor may have made them edible, but the bars don't even taste like strawberries.  The strongest flavor is dates, and I like dates, but no way can they stand their own with the vile texture.<br /><br />On the plus side they are vegan, non-GMO, and organic.  I appreciate that, but these are bars I could only eat if I was trapped somewhere without food."
883,B0037QGKSK,2,1269734400,"Labeling these as strawberry flavored borders on false advertising; they're made primarily from dates and rolled oats and that's pretty much what they taste like.  There is strawberry in them, but I really can't taste it.  They are by no means inedible, but they have sort of a gummy, mildly unpleasant consistency.  Since they're mostly dates, honestly I'd rather just eat a handful of dried dates (I really like dates; it's sort of ironic that they took something I like and screwed it up so they could make a bar out of it).<br /><br />I guess they're a fairly healthy thing to stick in your desk if you may want a snack...but I'd have to be pretty hungry to really enjoy them.  I'd be happier snacking on dried dates and maybe some nuts.  My kids HATED them."
884,B0037QGKSK,2,1269734400,"I was really expecting to like this all natural, organic fruit bar, but, frankly, I did not particularly enjoy it.<br /><br />It has a strange, grainy and chewy consistency, which put me off right away.  I could taste some strawberry, but mostly I could taste dates.  I do like dates. I like all kinds of dried fruits, but I, personally, would not buy this product.<br /><br />I usually eat Nutri-grain bars and here is a breakdown of the two bars.  The size of the Probar is 1.7 oz. compared to the Nutri Grain of 1.3 so that must be taken into consideration:<br /><br />Nutri Grain<br />Calories - 130<br />Total Fat 3 grams<br />Saturated Fat 0.5 grams<br />No Trans Fat or Cholesterol<br />Sodium - 105  mg<br />Carbs - 24 grams<br />Fiber - 2 grams<br />Sugars - 12 grams<br />Protein - 2 grams<br /><br />Probar Fruition<br />Calories - 160<br />Total Fat 2 grams<br />Saturated Fat - 0 grams<br />No Trans Fat or Cholesterol<br />Sodium - 20 mg<br />Carbs -  34 grams<br />Fiber -  4 grams<br />Sugars - 22 grams<br />Protein - 3 grams<br /><br />Based on the above comparison, Probar is probably the healthier choice.  If I could get past the consistency, that would be the best choice, but I guess my palate is not suited to my eat this kind of snack bar.  I struggled to finish just one."
885,B0037QGKSK,4,1269734400,"The Fruition Strawberry bars are among the better tasting nutrition/snack bars out there. Nutritionally they are solid, made from fruits, seeds, nuts and oats. There are even 4 grams of dietary fiber which is great. My one concern is the whopping 22 grams of sugar. That's excessive. There is a likely cause, which is the added brown rice syrup. Not sure this bar needed that additional level of sweetness. Also, they are 100% vegan and non GMO, and certified organic by QAI.<br /><br />Thing is? The price. It's simply far too high. At over $2 per bar, there are better options on the market. The lowest price I could find online still put them at $1.75 per bar. Too high to buy regularly for me, sorry Pro Bar! Normally I would have removed a star for the very high price, but this review is based solely on the product itself since buying it was not part of my experience.<br /><br />If cost is no object to you, these are a great alternative to processed candy snacks though."
886,B0037QGKSK,5,1269734400,"Unlike sports bars and energy bars, there are absolutely no filler ingredients in this bar.  It is date-based, with natural flavorings and seeds added, and most of the ingredients are organic. This is a vegan bar, which doesn't much matter to me since I'm not even close to vegetarian.  But I do tend toward the healthy side, and finding a bar that is good for you, and delicious, without loads of added sugar and JUNK, is a great thing.  They're dense, but they don't feel ""heavy"" in your stomach.  It's a pleasant texture, with none of that sawdust-feel that comes with ""healthy"" sports bars, and no ""crisp-rice"" that comes with some energy bars I've tried, which it seems to me are nothing more than Rice Crispies Treats.<br /><br />I'm using these bars as in-between snacks to stave off hunger, say, before a late dinner, or after a workout when it's not quite time for a meal.  Dates are full of natural sugars, so they are also high in carbs. Even though I'm low-carb, I won't hesitate to enjoy these once a day."
887,B0037QGKSK,5,1269648000,"This is a review of Fruition Strawberry bars<br /><br />Nutrition: Each bar contains 160 calories.  This seems to be a little higher than in some other bars I have, especially since the description says that it does not contain ""extra"" fat and calories.  Still, 160 calories is not excessive, especially of you're looking for an energy boost during or after exercise.  It only contains 2g of fat, and no saturated fat, which is good. It does have a fair amount of fiber (4g), again, a good thing.<br /><br />Ingredients: It claims to have organic, vegan, non-GMO ingredients, which is good.  Because of its bad rap, many foods are now using alternatives to high-fructose corn syrup, which seems to be in about everything.  There is none of that in these bars. However, the third largest ingredient in these bars is ""rice syrup.""  This is really just a form of sugar (maltose, glucose and maltotriose).  Other major ingredients are made from dates, strawberries, and apple juice.  Although these are ""strawberry"" bars, Strawberry puree is the 4th ingredient, when listed by volume. It also contains strawberry flavoring, Arabic gum and several other ingredients.  Overall though, all of the ingredients seem reasonable.  The ingredient list is much shorter than on similar bars and they were no unpronounceable chemical in the list.<br /><br />Taste:  Overall I was pleased with the taste of the bars. They were not overly fruity or excessively sweet and had a nice consistency.<br /><br />Final Verdict:  Although I did some nitpicking, these are reasonably healthy fruit bars and have an enjoyable taste.  I'd recommend them if you looking for a healthy snack in bar form."
888,B0037QGKSK,5,1269648000,"The Simply Real Fruition PROBAR is tasty, filling and easy to eat.  The strawberry bar has a mild understated flavor to it.  There is a nice fig Newton-like grittiness to it, due to the cashews and seed pieces that are in the bar.  For just 160 calories, it is remarkably filling to eat.  This is light enough to eat on the run, or just before a run or workout.  This is a terrific alternative to other health bars."
889,B0037QGKSK,4,1269648000,"Let me begin by saying that I am not a vegan, & I ordered this product assuming it was similar to a granola bar. That being said, I think that vegans or those on raw food diets will probably love this product. I am apologizing in advance for my ignorance to the vegan lifestyle & raw food diet.<br /><br />The bar has just enough strawberry taste so as not to be overwhelming, & the taste isn't artificial. I also love that each bar contains 4 grams of fiber because it can be difficult to find high fiber foods that also taste good. I would eat these bars based on the fiber content alone. The cost seems high to me, but I am not used to buying these types of food. Overall, I would say that the Fruition bar tasted pretty good to a meat eater."
890,B0037QGKSK,4,1269475200,"I have had a Fruition Strawberry Snack Bar for my afternoon snack today.  The taste is unusual and one can taste the elements, a bit of nuts, some dates and oats, and strawberry puree.  The bar is nicely chewy without pulling out your teeth - not as crunchy as granola, which is a good thing.  I give this item 4 stars.  It loses one star because there is a sort of sour aftertaste that lingers.  Overall they are good."
891,B0037QGKSK,5,1269475200,"I received this product throught the Vines program and could not have been more surpised or pleased with a product.  If you have ever had a Cliff Bar or Laura Bar and wished for something between the two, look no further!  This bar comprises what I feel is the best of both.  It is easy to chew (not hard or gritty) and it is also not sticky (who needs sticky hands when you are either hiking or bicycling?).<br /><br />The bars are easy to open one handed while riding and do not require a ton of water to consume!  Do not let go of the wrapper though, remember to put it into your pocket!  The package that I received were strawberry and while the bars have a good fruit flavor, I would have been hard pressed to say ""strawberry"" if I had not known ahead of time.  Still, they are convenient, taste good, and are easy to carry in a Jersey pocket or pack.<br /><br />These bars have earned a definate place in my riding essentials and hiking essentials list.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
892,B0037QGKSK,4,1269475200,"PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry is a very yummy treat for your taste buds and it's all natural goodness.  I was surprised by the fresh taste of this fruit bar (a lot of different bars I have tried over the years tend to be kind of stale) and for being a vegan friendly/health food, I was impressed by it's taste.  If you're looking for a natural alternative to the plethora of mass produced and chemically enhanced nutrition/energy bar then you'll want to pick up one of these.  Try it. you'll like it."
893,B0037QGKSK,3,1269475200,"I took these into work for my coworkers to try.  Oddly, some of them complained it was too sweet, others that it was not sweet enough.  There seems to be the same range of opinion in these reviews.  I suppose we all have different ideas of what constitutes 'sweet'.  The overall verdict on the bars was that they were acceptable, but not great.<br /><br />The texture is soft, and slightly chewy - a paste.  The flavor is mostly dates or figs, with only a hint of strawberry.  Neither texture nor flavor were to my personal taste.<br /><br />If you incorporate supposedly healthy snack bars into your diet, then you want as much variety as possible, so you should try one of these to see if it suits.  But take note of the price."
894,B0037QGKSK,1,1269216000,"I have never written a one star review.  Ever.  Now, I've broken that hurdle with these bars.  I'd give them minus stars if I could.  They're that bad.  What putrid cesspool did these come from?  I've seen more appetizing grizzly bear poop that probably would've tasted better.<br /><br />I picked these up from the post office and was hungry and thought I'd try them.  Strawberry, organic and all natural -- sounded really good.  I eat organic and all natural foods, so it's not like I'm  unfamiliar with the concept.  The box said they were vegan.  Okay, not all vegan stuff is great, but a lot is pretty tasty.  This stuff is horrid.  I can't begin to tell you what they taste like -- sickly sweet paste with sawdust and a bit of strawberry flavor might come close.  The word ""super food"" is a lie -- I hated the bar immediately, regardless of how good it was supposed to be for me.  I handed a piece to my husband who likes twigs and granola and he made a face.  One of my dogs took a sniff and walked away.  I convinced her to take a piece and she set it down and sort of ate it --  and then looked at me like I had played some cruel joke.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with 11 bars to foist off on people I hate.  I could've gotten a cool book read and instead I opted for this.  Don't buy these, they're nasty."
895,B0037QGKSK,5,1269302400,"I wrote a four-star review of this product 14 days ago. How do i know that? Not by the date, but because I've just finished the last bar. I had written I liked this product, but now I'm hooked! In spite of the high price, I will be ordering more. Very sneaky, Probar, for giving them away. And now, fourteen days later, I realize that my four star review had to go. The Fruition bar is now my favorite snack.<br /><br />These are not ""granola bars."" Their texture is akin to a Fig Newton's center. I had originally written that I wished they had more variation in texture, but I came to really love the chewy, gummy quality of these bars, and enjoy the simplicity of them. Doesn't sound very appetizing, but they are quite delicious, and the 1.7 ounce bar actually fills me up, which is not something I can say about any other snack bar I've tried.<br /><br />There is not much strawberry taste, which I find good, for strawberries, when not fresh, can taste truly fake. These do not. In my opinion, they have just about the right amount of sweetness, though one reviewer wrote ""too sweet"". Sweetness is rather a Three Bears kind of thing, isn't it? Unless there was either no sweetness at all or a ridiculous amount, sweetness is one of the most subjective tastes there is. I know one person who thinks three tablespoons of sugar in one 6 ounce cup of coffee is perfection, so if you're anything like him, pass these by and pick up one of those snack bars that is a candy bar in misleading packaging. This is not one of those!<br /><br />The predominant taste is of dates, quite like a the aforementioned Fig Newton, but less sticky. The date paste, oats, and brown rice syrup are all organic, but the rest of the product is not, which is too bad. Another negative is the relative lack of nutritional value for a 160 calorie bar, but it's about the same as most. Since I've enjoyed these bars so much, I'm not complaining about any of it - just supplying information.<br /><br />I love the chia seeds, and I would imagine they add greatly to the price of this product. For whatever reason, those seeds are expensive - I've seen them sold for sixteen to twenty bucks at health food stores, so when I'm grumbling about the price of the Fruition bar, I should keep that in mind. I add chia seeds to many foods. They're great for the digestive system.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a big taste sensation, you might be disappointed. If not, I'd highly recommend these bars. I'm sorry I've run out. That's a great review in of itself."
896,B0037QGKSK,1,1271289600,"If you actually finish eating an entire bar, then good for you because you must have no taste buds. If I didn't get these for free, I would never even consider purchasing them. Nobody cares about how healthy something is if it feels like a brick sitting in your stomach. I brought the rest to work to get rid of them and the reaction there was exactly the same as mine. Needless to say, I threw the rest in the trash. Forget this strawberry 'snack' bar and eat a real piece of fruit instead."
897,B0037QGKSK,5,1269475200,"It has a very nice appearance when you take the wrapper off.  It has a very good taste, and is full of fruit.  You can use this as a quick meal, when you are short on time."
898,B0037QGKSK,3,1269475200,"The manufacturer claims these snack bars are made with organic, vegan ingredients. The top four ingredients, as listed, are organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, and strawberry puree. While it's clear these bars are nutritious and very possibly wholesome, they don't really taste good.  In fact, they look kind of ugly and unappetizing upon opening, and sort of smells funny, too.<br /><br />Each bar weighs 48 oz. and packs 180 calories, 20 of which from fat. There's 0g saturated fat and 0g trans fat (remember, 0g means anything less than 0.5g, since these guys are allowed to round the numbers). Cholesterol is 0mg and sodium 20mg. Total carbs is 34g, with 4g of dietary fiber and 22g of sugar, not great if you're diabetic.<br /><br />In short, if you love wholesome foods, you'll probably like this. But if you want healthy foods that also taste decent, this is probably not it, but perhaps still worth a try.<br /><br />Box says ""made in the USA,"" but no mention of where the ingredients come from."
899,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"***Edited on 5/25/2010***<br />I've eaten a few of the bars and shared them with others.  Everyone really likes them.  My only problem is that I believe I am allergic to something in them.  I find my throat and inner ears get itchy when I eat them.  I can't blame the bar too much since I'm the one with the reaction.  I rarely react to foods, so this was a surprise to me.  I'm adding this as a note for others who may have allergies.<br /><br />****original review***<br /><br />I eat lots of different ""snack bars.""  I've tried a number of different vegan or organic bars and these rate up there will the top ones.<br />In essence, these are date bars with a strawberry flavor.  The strawberry taste was more an aftertaste for me not hitting until well after I had started eating the bar.  They are soft and chewy and a nice snack.  I tried eating it for breakfast (I'm not a big breakfast eater, but eat a lot of these types of bars for breakfast), but I was hungry an hour later.  So, they are good for a quick snack, but I wouldn't rely on it for keeping hunger away for more than an hour or two.<br />If you don't like dates, avoid these.  If you are looking for an abundance of strawberries, don't look to these.  If you want a quick snack that is healthy, then go for it."
900,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"Lately I have been trying to avoid the sugary snacks and started buying snack bars that have more healthy nutritional values.  Having just finish off my box of Clif bars, I was interested in trying these PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bars.  Taste is slightly higher than the bland of the oatmeal with a Strawberry flavoring mingled with Date Paste.  Not an unpleasant taste but only one of my kids like it.  The ingredients show no sugars added so the 22g of sugar must come from the Date Paste, Brown Rice Syrup, Strawberry Puree, and Apple Juice.  The superfood name is more than likely derived from the additional ingredient of white and black Chia Seeds.  In today's health world there are many Chia Seed claims, but I'm not sure all of these are proven yet.  This is not a bad snack bar and does satisfy the afternoon hunger cravings.  With the price of over $2 a bar, these are considerably higher than other snack bars out there..I think Clif bars were around $1 per bar. I would still look into buying a few of these to have on hand when the vending machine starts calling."
901,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"If you were to give me this bar site unseen I never would have guessed it to be a strawberry bar.  It's not.  The primary ingredient is organic date paste, followed by oats, brown rice sugar, and then finally strawberry puree.<br /><br />But it's not a bad taste at all, especially if you like dates like I do.  Although the bar is gooey, it breaks down fast and doesn't stick to your teeth.  It's like eating the insides of a Fig Newton, seeds and all.  I don't taste any cashews although they are also listed as an ingredient.<br /><br />Although the taste is not what I expected, this is not a bad fruit bar.  It's not crumbly or crunchy and it packs easily inside a backpack.  But if it's strawberries you want, you may want to look elsewhere.  Although there are strawberries in this bar, the taste is well disguised.<br /><br />One bar yields 160 calories, 3% fat, 11% carbs, 1% sodium.  This is not recommended for diabetics."
902,B0037QGKSK,3,1269302400,"There are foods that are so good, you eat them even if they're bad for you.  Then there are foods you have to kind of force yourself to eat because you know they're healthy.  This bar leans toward the latter type.  If you took strawberry oatmeal, mixed in some wheat germ for added grainy texture and somehow got it congeal/solidify into a bar these would be the end result.  True, I don't find them as inedible as a Soyjoy bar (which can only be described as flavored, pressed sawdust).  These are a dense, filling and portable nutrition bar not to be mistaken for a treat.  I'm going to put the rest of mine in the car for emergency rations should I ever get stuck in an inordinately long traffic jam...or maybe a snowdrift."
903,B0037QGKSK,2,1269216000,"This is the stuff that the aliens will feed their pet humans when they take over the world. ""Human Sustenance Product, Strawberry Flavor. Give your pets the very best! Promotes bright eyes and a shiny pelt. Recommended by 4 out of 5 humanologists!"" It will come with a label that has a smiling human on it. I can see it now.<br /><br />It tastes like cookie dough without the delicious grainy sweetness. Pasty. Tastes uncooked. Does not really taste like strawberries at all. Lays in your stomach like a lump of...well. Now, it is a very healthy slab of icky paste, and I like that it's not too sweet. It is also gluten-free if your branch of religion believes that oats are gluten-free. However, these lumps will only serve to be my desperation snack for those extra hungry late afternoons."
904,B0037QGKSK,4,1269388800,"These snack bars say they're ""packed with fresh, healthy ingredients.""  You can believe that -- one bite will tell you they're full of quality whole grains.<br /><br />Label also says ""bold fruit flavors.""  Well -- the strawberry flavor IS there, but it's certainly not what you'd call ""bold.""  ""Pleasant"" is more like it.<br /><br />These definitely aren't as much fun as eating a candy bar or even some of the other snack/cereal bars that are out there.  But, they do satisfy a snack craving and I'm enjoying them."
905,B0037QGKSK,2,1269216000,"I was expecting a sort of organic version of a fruit rollup but instead this is more of your standard energy bar with a vague strawberry taste. Imagine sawdust mixed with juice and a few strawberries. Given that the ingredient lists starts with Date Paste, Rolled Oats, Brown Rice Syrup and the Strawberry Puree I guess that is pretty much what I should have expected. 160 calories, 2 grams fat, 3 grams protein, 4 grams fiber, 22 grams sugars and 20 mg of sodium per 1.7 oz bar."

913,B000CQC0BE,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
914,B000CQC0BE,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
915,B000CQC0BE,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
916,B000CQC0BE,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations.

918,B000CQC0BE,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."

923,B000CQC0BE,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
924,B000CQC0BE,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
925,B000CQC0BE,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
926,B000CQC0BE,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
927,B000CQC0BE,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.

931,B000CQC0BE,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
932,B000CQC0BE,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
933,B000CQC0BE,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
934,B000CQC0BE,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
935,B000CQC0BE,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
936,B000CQC0BE,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
937,B000CQC0BE,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
938,B000CQC0BE,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
939,B000CQC0BE,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
940,B000CQC0BE,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
941,B000CQC0BE,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
942,B000CQC0BE,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
943,B000CQC0BE,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
944,B000CQC0BE,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
945,B000CQC0BE,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
946,B000CQC0BE,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
947,B000CQC0BE,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
948,B000CQC0BE,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
949,B000CQC0BE,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
950,B000CQC0BE,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
951,B000CQC0BE,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
952,B000CQC0BE,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
953,B000CQC0BE,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
954,B000CQC0BE,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
955,B000CQC0BE,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
956,B000CQC0BE,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
957,B000CQC0BE,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
958,B000CQC0BE,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
959,B000CQC0BE,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
960,B000CQC0BE,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
961,B000CQC0BE,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
962,B000CQC0BE,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
963,B000CQC0BE,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
964,B000CQC0BE,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
965,B000CQC0BE,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
966,B000CQC0BE,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
967,B000CQC0BE,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
968,B000CQC0BE,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
969,B000CQC0BE,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
970,B000CQC0BE,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
971,B000CQC0BE,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
972,B000CQC0BE,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
973,B000CQC0BE,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
974,B000CQC0BE,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
975,B000CQC0BE,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
976,B000CQC0BE,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
977,B000CQC0BE,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
978,B000CQC0BE,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
979,B000CQC0BE,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
980,B000CQC0BE,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
981,B000CQC0BE,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
982,B000CQC0BE,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
983,B000CQC0BE,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
984,B000CQC0BE,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
985,B000CQC0BE,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
986,B000CQC0BE,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
987,B000CQC0BE,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
988,B000CQC0BE,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
989,B000CQC0BE,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"

991,B000CQC0BE,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
992,B000CQC0BE,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
993,B000CQC0BE,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
994,B000CQC0BE,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
995,B000CQC0BE,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
996,B000CQC0BE,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
997,B000CQC0BE,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
998,B000CQC0BE,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
999,B000CQC0BE,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
1000,B000CQC0BE,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
1001,B000CQC0BE,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
1002,B000CQC0BE,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
1003,B000CQC0BE,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
1004,B000CQC0BE,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
1005,B000CQC0BE,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.

1013,B000CQIDK6,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
1014,B000CQIDK6,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
1015,B000CQIDK6,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
1016,B000CQIDK6,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
1017,B000CQIDK6,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
1018,B000CQIDK6,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
1019,B000CQIDK6,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
1020,B000CQIDK6,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
1021,B000CQIDK6,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
1022,B000CQIDK6,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
1023,B000CQIDK6,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
1024,B000CQIDK6,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
1025,B000CQIDK6,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
1026,B000CQIDK6,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
1027,B000CQIDK6,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1028,B000CQIDK6,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
1029,B000CQIDK6,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
1030,B000CQIDK6,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
1031,B000CQIDK6,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
1032,B000CQIDK6,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
1033,B000CQIDK6,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
1034,B000CQIDK6,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
1035,B000CQIDK6,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
1036,B000CQIDK6,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
1037,B000CQIDK6,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
1038,B000CQIDK6,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
1039,B000CQIDK6,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
1040,B000CQIDK6,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
1041,B000CQIDK6,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
1042,B000CQIDK6,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
1043,B000CQIDK6,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
1044,B000CQIDK6,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
1045,B000CQIDK6,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
1046,B000CQIDK6,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
1047,B000CQIDK6,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
1048,B000CQIDK6,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
1049,B000CQIDK6,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
1050,B000CQIDK6,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
1051,B000CQIDK6,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
1052,B000CQIDK6,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
1053,B000CQIDK6,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
1054,B000CQIDK6,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
1055,B000CQIDK6,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
1056,B000CQIDK6,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
1057,B000CQIDK6,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
1058,B000CQIDK6,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
1059,B000CQIDK6,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
1060,B000CQIDK6,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
1061,B000CQIDK6,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
1062,B000CQIDK6,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
1063,B000CQIDK6,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
1064,B000CQIDK6,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
1065,B000CQIDK6,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
1066,B000CQIDK6,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
1067,B000CQIDK6,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
1068,B000CQIDK6,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
1069,B000CQIDK6,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
1070,B000CQIDK6,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
1071,B000CQIDK6,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1072,B000CQIDK6,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
1073,B000CQIDK6,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
1074,B000CQIDK6,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
1075,B000CQIDK6,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
1076,B000CQIDK6,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
1077,B000CQIDK6,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
1078,B000CQIDK6,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
1079,B000CQIDK6,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
1080,B000CQIDK6,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
1081,B000CQIDK6,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
1082,B000CQIDK6,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
1083,B000CQIDK6,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
1084,B000CQIDK6,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
1085,B000CQIDK6,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
1086,B000CQIDK6,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
1087,B000CQIDK6,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
1088,B000CQIDK6,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
1089,B000CQIDK6,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
1090,B000CQIDK6,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
1091,B000CQIDK6,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
1092,B000CQIDK6,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
1093,B000CQIDK6,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
1094,B000CQIDK6,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
1095,B000CQIDK6,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
1096,B000CQIDK6,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
1097,B000CQIDK6,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
1098,B000CQIDK6,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
1099,B000CQIDK6,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
1100,B000CQIDK6,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
1101,B000CQIDK6,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
1102,B000CQIDK6,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
1103,B000CQIDK6,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
1104,B000CQIDK6,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
1105,B000CQIDK6,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
1106,B000CQIDK6,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
1107,B000CQIDK6,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
1108,B000CQIDK6,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
1109,B000GZSDSA,1,1229990400,"I loved these until I found out they were made in China. After they tainted baby formula, there is no way Im gong ot give these to my child."
1110,B000GZSDSA,1,1283040000,Last time I checked a package of these in the market they were made in CHINA.
1111,B000GZSDSA,2,1222992000,"I bought the crackers for my baby son and he LOVED them. I liked very much that the ingredient list is so short. But then I discovered that the crackers are made in China - stopped giving them to my son and threw them all out. After all the lead in toys for children and melanin in baby milk, I just try to buy as little as possible that is made in China - and definitely nothing that my son will eat! If these crackers were made in the USA, I would totally recommend and buy them again."
1112,B000GZSDSA,2,1291680000,"I saw ""Japonica rice"" and made the mistake of thinking these were made in Japan.  Realized they are actually made in China.  I avoid buying anything made in China, if possible, because of the political ramifications, but particularly avoid buying products for my infant made in China because of the safety issues.<br /><br />My daughter did enjoy these, but I won't be buying them again."
1113,B000GZSDSA,1,1278201600,"I tried this item for the first time after having purchased from Walmart. I thought it would be good, especially I noticed an ""award"" emblem on the front of the package. After opening and trying this product, I don't really know what that award was truly for. Being very environmentally conscious, I feel that the packaging is too excessive, the rusks are individually wrapped in non-recyclable something(?), and all the individual packets are packaged in non recyclable plastic film, all contained in a carboard box. I also didn't realize that this was made in China at the time I purchased it (I was in a hurry). My 9 month old can't eat these right now - I will go back to other dissolvable foods like ""puffs"" for now. My four year old, however, wants to eat these more than my 9 month old and since my four year old is so skinny, these are not the ideal snacks for her either, since they don't have much nutritional value if you read the side of the box. I love Amazon, but I would never order this particular item from them and I would not reccommend this item to new parents."
1114,B000GZSDSA,1,1276905600,"I went to BRU today to buy these after seeing how great a 6 month old was able to handle them. Every time I give my son a teether biscuit (Gerber or Earth's Best), he ends up chewing off a huge chunk and almost choking.  The 6 month old who was eating these today had no choking problems because they melt.  I was so excited to buy these.  As I was walking to the register, I saw that they are made in China. Also, if you look at the ingredients, they have nothing of any value in them.  Just empty calories...no protein, no vitamins, no fiber, no nothing."
1115,B000GZSDSA,1,1299715200,I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who's baby loves them only to discover once they arrived that they're made in China. Not something I'm willing to feed my baby.
1116,B000GZSDSA,1,1314662400,"I've been looking at all the local grocery stores for teething biscuits for my 7 month old daughter. When I didn't find any there, I ordered a case of these. Unfortunately it's a total waste of money. I tried giving them to my daughter twice and both times she instantly broke off a piece that was perfect choking size. They're too easily broken to be good gnawing biscuits, and don't melt in the mouth fast enough to overcome that problem. It's back to the drawing board for me while whole boxes of these sit unused. For what it's worth, they're also really bland flavored."
1117,B000GZSDSA,3,1202515200,"I really want to try this product after reading all the wonderful reviews, but the fact that they are made in China really concerns me."
1118,B000GZSDSA,1,1319414400,"While these seems tasty and have a good texture, they are made in China. Despite what the manufacturer or anyone else says, while I might let my child play with a toy or wear clothes made in China, I would not let my child ingest any food made in China.  My colleagues at work have visited with manufacturers of all types of products in China (including food) and based on what I have heard from their first hand accounts as well as the known incidents such as melamine milk, I would not let my baby put food made in China is his mouth.  Sorry, not worth the risk in my opinion."
1119,B000GZSDSA,1,1318809600,"I'll buy clothing and electronics if it's made in China, but NO WAY I'll food - it's just too risky. Even some of the middle class there have started their own farming because they know they can't trust the government to regulate food safety... So, I'm hugely disappointed to learn that about these especially since I love how my little one is happy to be able to hold the cracker by herself. Won't be buying any more of these!"
1120,B000GZSDSA,4,1226016000,"This is what my wife wrote about these on her blog:<br />Pros: Great as a first finger food, low choking risk, tastes good, not very messy, packaged conveniently for on-the-go snack, does not contain wheat.<br />Cons: Not sold in most supermarkets (have only found them at Walmart and Sam's Club and on Amazon.com), caused me temporary panic b/c they are made in China and contain skim milk powder BUT there seems to be no cause for concern.<br /><br />I've been giving Baby Mum-Mum rice crackers to SB as a snack since he was about 7 months old, and it was love at first bite. I taste all the stuff I give to SB to see how edible they are, and I have to say that they are pretty darn tasty. The crackers are very light and airy and sort of melt in your mouth as you chew (or mash in SB's case). They have a lightly sweet taste that makes them easy to eat. The box contains 12 conveniently wrapped packages of 2 crackers each - perfect for sticking in your diaper bag for snack time on the go.<br /><br />After SB's bottom front teeth came in at about 6.5 months, I started looking for a teething cracker or biscuit that doesn't have wheat in it (I read that it's better to wait until baby is 9-12 months old before introducing wheat due to the allergy risk) and couldn't find anything in the grocery aisles, surprisingly. Then I came across Baby Mum-Mums at my local Walmart, which are made of rice, not wheat. Although Baby Mum-Mums aren't exactly a teething cracker, they were close enough for me. I mainly wanted something that SB could practice biting and chewing on. They've turned out to be the perfect starter finger food.<br /><br />Initially, I would hold the cracker for SB as he chomped on it, but after a little encouragement, he started taking the cracker in his own hand and feeding himself. Yay, his first successful attempt at finger food self-feeding! The crackers were great for giving him finger food practice, since they are easy for his little hands to clasp and big enough for him to find his mouth with it. As you can see from the picture, they have a long oval shape and are pretty thin, so it's easy to bite off pieces. And they don't create much mess at all - a few crumbs here and there. I've found them to be a great distraction for SB when he gets fussy on car rides or in his stroller.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about Baby Mum-Mums. The box highlights the following:<br /><br />-No Artificial Colors or Flavors<br />-No Preservatives<br />-Gluten, Egg & Peanut Free<br />-Baked, Low in Fat & No Trans Fat<br />-No Added Fats or Oils<br /><br />But there is another important thing to note about these crackers. They are made in China AND contain milk powder. About a week after the melamine-tainted milk scandal came to light in China, it suddenly hit me that my SB's beloved Baby Mum-Mums might be one of the foods affected by the tainted milk. I went straight to the web to see what information I could dig up on Mum-Mums and the melamine issue, and...it seems that they are safe. A big sigh of relief. This is what I found:<br /><br />Statement from National Importers (importer/distributor of the product): This basically states that Mum-Mums contain milk powder imported from New Zealand and that food authorities in China, Australia, Canada, and the US have tested batches of Mum-Mums with results all coming back negative for melamine contamination.<br /><br />The full post:  sammybearsays.blogspot.com/2008/10/baby-mum-mum-rice-rusks.html"
1121,B000GZSDSA,5,1276646400,"My husband and I came from Taiwan and have been living in the US for over 15 years. Normally we only buy Chinese snacks that are brand names and made in US or Taiwan. However, I was very glad to find this product in Amazon even though I just bought it today and haven't yet received it. I do know ""Hot Kid"" very well and used to have it for snack growing up in Taiwan. It was one of my few favorite snacks made by a well reputed Taiwanese company. I trust this brand just as I do General Mills or Kraft. It was already a major food company in Taiwan back then and ""rice rusk"" was the most popular product. Now, this company has made its way to becoming one of the three biggest food companies in China. Interesting enough, these three companies are all Taiwanese companies. I think the main reason is that people in China do not trust their own brands. I believe that ""Hot Kid""is a quality food product. I think the worry is overdone and the red flag is unnecessary. My son is 7 months now and it was a pleasing surprise to have found this product in US."
1122,B000GZSDSA,5,1311897600,"Oh my, as the mother of the world's crankiest teether, I should have been on the lookout for something like this. Honestly, I'm smacking myself in the forehead for not trying mum-mums earlier. Because my son? He loves him some mum-mum. They let him happily gnaw away before dissolving into non-choking hazard goo, and this kid has been pretty unimpressed with all those other teething products out there. I know because I own them all. Seriously, all of them. Sophie? Berry teether? Water ring teether? Bead teether? Mesh feeder-teether thing? Ice cube in a washcloth? They're all garbage in my sons eyes. Some asian rice rusks with a funny name=LOVE.<br /><br />Pros: I can find them at my local Walmart. They're perfectly portioned with two to a package (like poptarts), and they're easily tossed into a diaper bag. I break them in half before handing them off to my son, but that's just because he has a tendency to randomly chuck things out his stroller, and this keeps him from wasting an entire precious mum-mum. I personally think they taste pretty good (I haven't tried the other flavors). Also, they're cheap, much cheaper than all those teething products I just listed up there.<br /><br />Cons: While somewhat sturdy, they are not crush proof, as evidenced by the large amount of mum-mum dust in my purse. They hold up much better if given their own diaper bag compartment, rather than tossed in with all the rest of your stuff. Also, while they dissolve into goo, that goo is gross, and it is super sticky as it dries. Nothing a couple of baby wipes can't fix, and fortunately, the goo doesn't stain."
1123,B000GZSDSA,4,1289174400,"The nutrition information is not what is on the box. The box does not list skim milk powder as an ingredient but does say that the product may contain traces of milk. I tried giving it to my 6 month old. She liked chewing on the rusk and only gagged a couple of times. However, it must contain milk because she is milk-protein intolerant and had a rash on her face and behind that evening. Too bad I can't return the other 5 boxes."
1124,B000GZSDSA,5,1239840000,"I first discovered this product while stocking the baby food aisle of my local Wal-Mart where I work. I'm always on the look-out for low fat, low carb products and this fits the bill. There are 12 foil wrapped Mum-Mums containing 2 crispy wafers each measuring 4 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches.A serving is two of these easy to open packets,just zip them open from top to bottom along the side. They dissolve easily in your mouth and are still sturdy enough to spread peanut butter between for a sandwich that even a toddler would love, or top with tuna or egg salad without getting soggy. Great as a salsa dipper.They are bland taste wise but they're made of rice and they're a healthy alternative."
1125,B000GZSDSA,5,1212537600,"I have 9 month old twins who have decided to be very independent.  Baby Mum Mums allow them to feed themselves and provide a snack that dissolves easily so that I do not worry.<br /><br />I have only tried the vegetable flavor Mum Mums, but as I said, the Twinsies  love them!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Note:  They are always sold out at our local store.  I'm considering getting a subscription to them on Amazon so that I don't have to be disappointed in the store."
1126,B000GZSDSA,5,1189209600,"As other reviewers say, these are great.  My baby loves them, they're not very messy and they're cheap!  The Amazon price is the same as the price at our nearby Walmart.  However, both Amazon and Walmart are frequently sold out of these because they are so popular.  So, stock up when they are available.<br /><br />Another plus (for us anyway) is that they are gluten free.  It is extremely hard to find good snack/finger foods for babies that don't have wheat flour in them.  Additionally, I've found that any that didn't have wheat usually had corn instead, which I'm also a little wary to give my baby for the first year at least.  These are just rice!  They are perfect.  I can't recommend them enough."
1127,B000GZSDSA,5,1338595200,"My son is 8 months old and a bit bored of puffs but wants to feed himself. I try to give him real foods that he can hold and eat but worry about choking. He often takes massive bites!<br /><br />He LOVES these. I think the big thrill is holding them and doing it himself. They pretty much melt in his mouth so they are very safe.<br /><br />When he is fussy and bored at restaurants, these buy us 10 more minutes. That is a lot in parent time!"
1128,B000GZSDSA,5,1331424000,"I bought these for my 9 mo old so she can learn to bite with her new front teeth. These are by far her favorite snacks. She can easily bite off a piece and they dissolve in her mouth quickly even if she takes a big bite. I also love the fact that these don't leave crumbs, so no clean up needed at all. Will try the other flavors when she runs out."
1129,B000GZSDSA,5,1316995200,"These are great! The kids love them, very healthy for them and they are very convenient with very little crumbs to clean up. They don't turn into a soggy cooie or cracker. We ordered them have from Amazon (much cheaper and with super fast delivery) in each flavor they offer after trying them from a local grocery store. The  kids seem to enjoy the banana and the strawbery the best, but they honestly go crazy as soon as they see the package come out of the cabinet. Highly recommended!!"
1130,B000GZSDSA,5,1316563200,These are great for babies and toddlers. Taste good and low in calories. I like to eat them for a low cal snack.
1131,B000GZSDSA,5,1306281600,"As a mom of four, I probably should've bought stock in Gerber considering how many Puffs we've gone through in the past 5 years.  I noticed these while shopping at Target and gave them to my son as his first self-fed food at about 7 mos. and he absolutely loved them.  He is now 10 mos. and prefers these to any other snack, including puffs.  They are easy to hold, dissolve quickly, don't leave too much mess, and are conveniently packaged in packs of 2 (great to toss in your bag).  I would highly recommend this to any mom.  They are hard to find in most supermarkets so I'm thrilled that Amazon has them now and at such a good price."
1132,B000GZSDSA,5,1290124800,"I love this baby snack.  It's cheaper to buy it in amazon compared to nearby supermarket.  I got my second order today and found I got 1 box, instead of 6 boxes... it's such a pain to contact Amazon and get a refund... (and tihs item is non-returnable which makes it more difficult to solve this problem). Maybe I'm the only one who had this problem, but just wanted to let you know."
1133,B000GZSDSA,5,1275868800,"I am so glad I gave these a try.  At first I got scared over the comments about them being made in China, but I checked the company website and did some research, and these seem to be more carefully monitored and tested than most baby food available in the states.  My baby is a bit behind in areas, with feeding being one of them.  I couldn't get him to even try self feeding, even though he is nine months.  Enter Baby Mum Mums...not only does he like them (I've tried them, they have a very mild slightly sweet taste), but he was able to hold onto them and self feed. Within days he was feeding himself smaller items such as Cheerios and yogurt bites as well.  Yeah!!! They melt quite easily so I do not worry about choking and as long as I monitor him he does better with these than any other food he can feed himself with.  However, always watch your baby while feeding these as there have been some babies who choked because they ate too much too fast and it gelled up in their throats--they can get somewhat sticky and dry.  My baby and I give mum mums 2 thumbs up! Also, Amazon's price can't be beat and I love having them delivered right to my door."
1134,B000GZSDSA,5,1239321600,"My son, almost 2, loves Mum Mums for snack time. It is good that it isn't high in fat or sugar.  He prefers them over candy. :)<br /><br />It was nice to order them online for the same/lower price as the local food stores."
1135,B000GZSDSA,4,1212192000,"My kids love baby mumums like you wouldn't believe.  So it was a no brainer when it came to buying them at a great price on Amazon (free super saver shipping...).  Knowing that when i buy them in the store, they have about a one year shelf life, I wasn't worried about not going through an entire case of them in that time.  To my surprise, the box must have been sitting in Amazon's wherehouse for a long time, because BOTH cases (the veggies rusks and original rice rusks) were manufactured in AUGUST 2007, expiring in August 2008.  Yup, this is the mont of May 2008...  so i now had 2 months to get my 9 month old and 2 year old to eat 48 packs of baby mum mums!!!!  wow.  Called Amazon, they sent 2 more cases.  same deal, same dates.  They say as long as they aren't expired, they can't control the dates of expiration for you.  bummer.  I am now in the possession of way to many baby mumums.  thankfully, I have a lot of friends with little ones..... they are great for the teething baby.  very crunchy. not as messy as teething biscuits! Amazon was very quick to try to help out and I give them credit for their understanding.  Just watch those expiration dates... ;)"
1136,B000GZSDSA,5,1212019200,"We started giving my daughter Mum mums at about 4 months of age. They were the only thing we were not afraid she would choke on, as they dissolve instantly. It also helped her learn how to feed herself and, before she had excellent dexterity, she could hold Mum mums herself because they were so large and easily graspable. My daughter is ten-months old now and still loves Mum mums. She knows the packaging and gets excited if you simply show her a pack of them. I would recommend these for growing infants over any other products."
1137,B000GZSDSA,5,1343260800,"For a long time, my son refused to eat jarred baby food and these were a lifesaver. He could hold them and eat them on his own, and he loved the texture (probably because he was teething). Highly recommended."
1138,B000GZSDSA,5,1337558400,"I got these when my youngest was a baby.  She loved them then and she loves them now as a toddler.  My preschooler really likes them too.  They're great snacks, because they're not messy, and they're not too filling so they're OK as a 'close to dinner time"" snack.  I also like that they're not artificially flavored or sugary.  They're easy to carry around in the car or the diaper bag too."
1139,B000GZSDSA,3,1333584000,"I have many food allergies so thought I'd try these rice biscuits. I didn't like them so gave them to a friend who has a baby. She said her baby ""JUST LOVES THEM."""
1140,B000GZSDSA,5,1332806400,"I don't know what it is about these, but babies seem to find them completely irresistible! They are great for babies who are just starting to explore finger foods. These were the only thing that made riding in the car with my now 3 year old daughter bearable as a baby. Now my 7 month old son, devours these. They dissolve easily so they're a bit more manageable than the Puffs or crunchy sticks from Gerber. I wish I'd known about the Subscribe & Save the first time around because we felt like we should invest in Mums with our daughter! Glad to save a little money AND have these shipped to our door this time around!"
1141,B000GZSDSA,5,1328400000,"Our 14 month old twin daughters loved these rusks when we were living in NZ, fast forward 2 weeks and we're living in Riyadh with no gluten-free baby products available. Luckily we were able to buy from Amazon and have shipped here to Riyadh. Whole process only took 6 days, so will definitely be ordering again. So much easier to order a box of 6-packs rather than previously buying from supermarket every few days back in NZ. For anyone unfamiliar with this product, the rusks turn soggy yet hold shape when they come into contact with liquids (i.e. saliva), so they were safe for our bubbies right from the start of solids introduction. The shape is a long wide oval, so easy to snap in half when appetites are small, yet come in two-packs wrapped in foil, so easy to keep fresh. The texture is kind of like foam, so no crumbs to clean up and therefore easy to eat when out for a meal."
1142,B000GZSDSA,5,1326153600,"I got a sample of these from a friend for my 6m son.  He LOVED them.  He doesn't like the puffs or other first 'solid' snacks because he chokes on them and they don't melt fast enough.  This was perfect.  He can hold the food himself so it doesn't slip down his throat.  It melts very quickly once it's in his mouth to prevent choking.<br /><br />As a mom, I love these.  They are PERFECT for when you have a little one that gets cranky watching everyone else eat.  When the whole family goes out to a restaurant we put him in the high chair and give him one of these rice snacks when the food is served.  It keeps him occupied and happy and lets everyone else enjoy their food while it's hot instead of playing 'pass the baby' and taking turns eating.<br /><br />Just ordered a bunch on Amazon.  They are also sold at Target and Wal-Mart.  I haven't tried any flavors with him other than the original and Banana.  Can't wait to buy some of the others and see what he thinks of them.  This is a wonderful product.... Oh and its Gluten free!! :)"
1143,B000GZSDSA,5,1315958400,My baby simply loves this biscuits. It's very tasty and dissolves quickly on baby's mouth. It is very good for the little ones.
1144,B000GZSDSA,5,1311724800,"Great snack for young eaters.  These are tasty, and interesting, for my almost one year old, she loves to ""bite"" foods and is avoiding baby foods, but still loves MumMums.  Started giving them at about 4 months old, and never had any issues with choking.  A really great snack, that does NOT make a big mess."
1145,B000GZSDSA,5,1309996800,"My 6 month old broke through two bottom teeth, began chewing on anything and everything I let her get her hands on and also would scream and cry when we started eating our meals everyday.  I was too scared to buy her teething biscuits for fear she would choke if she bit off a piece.  So, I found these and tried them out.  These Rice Rusks dissolve instantly almost and keep me worry free as she grabs a hold of them and eats them with out my help.  I still hold her and watch her of course, but she loves the freedom of holding them herself and chomping down on them.  They are also really tasty.  The original taste sweet, the banana taste like banana and I haven't tasted the vegetable one yet.  I have recommended this to my friends and gone on and on about how much she loves them. If you decided to try these out, I hope your baby enjoys them as much as mine does.  Also, shop around for prices they seem to overprice at certain stores."
1146,B000GZSDSA,5,1306886400,"I have tried teething biscuits with my eldest child when she was an infant, and boy were they ever a mess. Not so with mum-mums. I won't say there is NO mess at all. I started giving these to my second daughter on the recommendation of a relative. She had just started sitting up unsupported -- about five months old. At first, she made a bit of a mess with them because she would drop them and pick them back up, drool all over them, etc. Now that she is seven months old, she really has the hang of the rice rusks, and although she does manage to get a bit here or there stuck to her clothing, she can self-feed herself and be done in a jiffy. (Which makes it less of an activity, but oh well. She loves them.)<br /><br />We tried the banana flavored mum-mums and they did seem to make a bit more mess than the originals.<br /><br />Rice rusks weigh about the same as air. They feel kind of like a rice cake. They don't smell like anything (well, the banana ones do, I guess). But the baby likes them a lot, and they are very handy to take along when traveling or shopping."
1147,B000GZSDSA,4,1306368000,"I really like this product ! It doesn't make you nervous like some baby foods while your baby is eating . I think this is the perfect first finger food for babies . My son loves it, it such a pure taste. But for a pack of 24 I have found this product at krogers  (Houston)  for  $2.00. I think im going to stock up now !"
1148,B000GZSDSA,5,1305072000,Both my kids love these mum mums.  I have to constantly tell my 3 1/2 year old daughter that these are for babies.  Every baby that I know of has loved these.
1149,B000GZSDSA,5,1304899200,"Great snack for young kids.  I've been giving them to my son since he was 7 months or so, he loves them!"
1150,B000GZSDSA,5,1302048000,My kids love these melt in your mouth crackers!  Nice snack for a little one learning to self feed.
1151,B000GZSDSA,5,1301529600,"great snack... perfect for little ones, my son was about 9 months old when I introduced him. and loves them!"
1152,B000GZSDSA,5,1299542400,Easy for my 10 month old to hold onto. He loves the taste and it's good for him! I think he enjoys how it melts in his mouth and that he's able to feed himself. He's been eating these since he was 8 months old.
1153,B000GZSDSA,5,1298937600,"We love love love the Baby Mum-mums. My son (9 months) bites into them and cracks them off the way an adult would bite into a candy bar. They are fairly flavorless (like a rice cake) and dissolve easily (like a puff), but they are so much more portable than a puff. We couldn't get through life without them!"
1154,B000GZSDSA,5,1297296000,"This was one of the first things my son ever ate.  He was an early teether and we found that he not only liked the taste, but the texture of the mum mums helped sooth his sore gums.  At almost 1 year he is still a fan of mum mums. We like them because they are very easily portable and I can give my son a snack without feeling like he's eating a bunch of junk."
1155,B000GZSDSA,4,1296432000,Mum mums are easy to feed our infant- he can do it himself! He stuffs these things in!<br /><br />They can get a little messy (like all infant food) and stick into things when wet.  If you clean them up while wet- no problem- but if they dry into clothes or the carpet they are pain.<br /><br />They taste pretty good (better than infant cereal!)and even my toddler asks for them- and in a pinch I've snacked on a few too.<br /><br />The only problem-  the packaging.  I ordered them by the 6 box case and more than half the crackers are broken.  The box was just the individual boxes of rusks in a cardboard case-- no padding.<br />Its very frustrating because the long shape is one of the reasons they are so easy for my 6 month old to feed himself. The pieces end up dropped much more easily than the original shape.<br /><br />Overall rating for the product= 5<br />for the condition in which they arrived- 3.
1156,B000GZSDSA,5,1293580800,"My 10 month old babies love these, and I love that they are organic.  My twins both got lots of teeth early, they have 8 each at 10 months and chew well, but still be sure to watch them closely while eating these as they can bite off large pieces and choke.  Still a great finger food."
1157,B000GZSDSA,5,1288224000,"My toddler has been eating these for several months and loves them. I love them because they don't crumble or make a mess, nor do they get goopy (yes, that is a technical term). They are a great snack to hold her over when the rest of the family isn't quite ready to eat."
1158,B000GZSDSA,5,1288051200,"I just love these rice rusks.  I found them when my older son was a baby and he continues to love them to this day (he is four).  I always have them in the house because they are perfect for a light snack (not too filling), provide a satisfying crunch, and are *just* sweet enough.  My 16 month old loves them as well.  As a mom, I like them because they don't really crumb as much as a traditional cracker - though they do tend to break easily.  The cleanup is easier if they DO break.  Amazon.com has a great deal with the case as well, we usually order them every other month or so."
1159,B000GZSDSA,5,1286150400,"My son (15 mo.) and daughter (3 y/o) both LOVE Mum Mums. We first tried these with my daughter when we started looking for teething biscuits. She had one teething biscuit, which made a nasty orange mess all over her and her clothes, AND a big piece broke off which she choked on. After that, I threw the rest of the box away. I then found Mum Mums, and they have been a fixture in our house/car/diaper bag/stroller since. We lovingly refer to these rice cakes as a ""little piece of our sanity."" When the kids were first on finger foods, they would slowly munch on these while we fixed meals or were waiting on our meals at restaurants. They disolve, so if a little piece breaks off, it's not a big deal. Their shape is good for little hands that are learning to get food to their mouths. As they have gotten older, they simply enjoy them as snacks. I buy these by the case, and I give a box to my friends as their kids get to that stage where they are wanting to feed themselves. 5 STARS!!!!!"
1160,B000GZSDSA,5,1282780800,My baby gets so excited when she sees one of these rice husks coming toward her... she loves to snack on these! They easily dissolve in her mouth so no teeth aren't a problem. I've tasted them and they taste pretty good (although there isn't much flavor to them). Highly recommend!
1161,B000GZSDSA,5,1281398400,"We have been giving this to our daughter for a few months now (she is almost 13 months.)  Its so easy for her to hold, it softens quite easily in her mouth so its easy for her to chew.  We buy them by the case and it lasts a while.  Quite affordable and its convenient."
1162,B000GZSDSA,5,1278374400,"This was my son's first finger food and at 10 months remains his favorite.  It is great for when you are on the go.  It isn't messy because it is one big piece rather then other traditional finger foods that are small pieces that get all over the stroller, car seat, and the ground.  This is easy for him to hold and feed himself from day one.  Great product!"
1163,B000GZSDSA,5,1278374400,I was glad to find these since the one grocery store that carries them is often out. These are the one thing I feel comfortable passing back to my 9 month old in the car with no fear of choking or a huge mess. I love them and always try to have them on hand in case of emergency fussiness
1164,B000GZSDSA,5,1277337600,"My son is allergy to wheat, nut, milk, soy.... when we found out these allergies, there is not much crackers he can eat. Baby Mum-Mum is the best for allergy kids or older babies, it taste good too. My son eat it for 2 years and never complain, still eating it almost everyday. Strongly recommended."
1165,B000GZSDSA,5,1272672000,"What a wonderful product!  I used these with my now 3 year old daughter when she was learning to eat solid foods.  I'm now using them with my youngest, now 10 month old daughter.  I started giving these to her when she was about 7 months old and she very easily eats them!  I love how they can hold them and they dissolve so easily... perfectly individually wrapped sizes are great for putting in your purse for them to munch on while shopping.  Highly encourage moms to buy these for their babies!"
1166,B000GZSDSA,5,1270944000,"When my grandson was teething he desperately wanted something to chew, but anything we gave him he would break off a bite and choke on it.  Mum Mums disolve in their litle mouths, especially since they are drooling so much anyway.  I could give him a Mum Mum and he was so happy, especially when we were in restaurants and he wanted food to eat too. Naturally you have to watch children when they eat but the chance of choking with these is slim to none.  And even better their little faces are not covered with cookie slime that dries like concrete."
1167,B000GZSDSA,5,1266192000,Got this for my granddaughter who loves this food and goes nuts when she sees the box.  I recommend this snack over the normal mushy stuff that's out there even though this is not a good teething biscuit.  Granddaughter likes to practice biting so this is great.  We don't have to worry about choking; it melts fairly quickly in the mouth.  Enjoy. It comes in different flavors too.
1168,B000GZSDSA,5,1259280000,My son loves these cookies and I feel good about giving them to him.  They are a great deal too :)
1169,B000GZSDSA,5,1247097600,"These are such great snacks for my little one. I began giving these when he was about 8 months and he still loves them (14months). I love the fact that they are healthy and not loaded down with artificial flavors and colors like so many snacks are. Ony gripe would be that they are very delicate and tend to break into tiny pieces when toting them aorund in my diaper bag. no big deal though. Oh, and they are hard to find....walmart has them but not consistently so I just order them in bulk on amazon"
1170,B000GZSDSA,5,1246320000,"My son is 11 months old and I just found them at the supermarket last week.  He LOVES them!<br /><br />My one and only complaint, is that I bought the last box at the supermarket and I can't find anymore anywhere!  I just had to order them off Amazon so I know I will be able to have some in the future!"
1171,B000GZSDSA,5,1246233600,My kids love it and it does not taste bad! I have tried them too...yummy!
1172,B000GZSDSA,5,1245369600,My 6.5 month old son loves them. Once he dropped a piece of mum-mum on the floor and my dog gobbled it up off the floor. Now every time my baby eats a mum-mum my dog is standing nearby waiting for a piece to drop on the floor.
1173,B000GZSDSA,5,1244764800,These are the best crackers for little ones!! They don't make a mess at all like the teething biscuits!  My baby girl loves them.  Our local store has been out of them for almost 2 months.  I was so grateful to find them on the internet!!  Yum Yum Mum Mum...
1174,B000GZSDSA,4,1243555200,"Mum mums are known as 'baby crack' in our house. They crunch satisfyingly yet melt easily, meaning no teeth is no problem and the mess is really minimal. They do tend to break and powder inside each pack of two, though."
1175,B000GZSDSA,5,1243296000,"These rice rusk's are great for your little teething infant. My son is 6 months old and has no problem eating these up. It's great for in between meals. They do tend to get a bit sticky and if they fall on a carpet floor, make sure to pick them up right away. Overall, these are great and not a choking hazard."
1176,B000GZSDSA,5,1237939200,"My 6mo old daughter absolutely loves these crackers! At first bites, she broke some pieces off and spit them out before it got any chance to melt in her mouth, but about a week later she learned how to ""chew"" them with her gums, since she doesn;t have any teeth yet!And my husband and I love to munch on these crackers too, when our baby let's us"
1177,B000GZSDSA,5,1235865600,"These ""cookies"" are perfect to distract the baby when staying in or going out. She loves them and gets excited when she sees the package. GREAT PRODUCT! I bought an entire case and am so glad I did."
1178,B000GZSDSA,5,1233792000,My daughter and I love these rusks!  She is one year old and has been eating them since she was about 7 months old.  I only wish I had known an organic variety was available!!  I definitely recommend them to any mom wanting a worry free finger food for their little one!
1179,B000GZSDSA,5,1231459200,"This was one of the first foods for my son who is now 7 months. It's easy to eat as it dissolves in their mouths - perfect for those without teeth. It is also easy to digest - basically rice and sugar. For me, they taste kind of like a giant Rice Krispie."
1180,B000GZSDSA,5,1230508800,I used to work in a preschool and I would buy these for my little ones. Their parents loved these snacks! 1. they were safe to swallow and gnaw on for a while. 2. they weren't messy 3. they are cheap and 4. the kids loved them. i think that little ones like these so much because they make a crunchy sound and they can hold it themselves. i now have moved on the toddler rice biscuit version of the mum-mums. they just came in today and my 19 month old loves them! too bad the organic ones are always on back order! great product!
1181,B000GZSDSA,5,1223251200,My 8 month old has enjoyed the Baby Mum Mums now for the last 2 months.  They're great for development (hand-eye coordination) and as a healthy snack.  Thumbs up!
1182,B000GZSDSA,5,1214870400,"I recently found these rice rusk cookies at my local WalMart, and was immediately drawn to the fact that they are nearly the only thing I could find for babies that does not contain any wheat, which I am trying to limit in my toddler son's diet.  The easily-graspable size and loud CRUNCH were an instant hit with him, and I have no qualms about handing him one without the necessity of watching him like a hawk to be sure he doesn't choke on it.<br /><br />I like to try the stuff I feed to my baby so I know what it tastes like, which turned out to be a mistake with these... because I love them!  They are light and airy, mildly sweet and browned just a tiny bit which adds to the flavor.  I now find myself looking for excuses to 'help him finish them up' (i.e. Now that the package has been opened, they'll go stale in the next 15 minutes if they're not all eaten right now!)<br /><br />I have a friend whose 9 month old is ready to try chewable foods, but mom is too afraid she will choke - I'm going to recommend these to help the transition proceed safely!  I was disappointed to find only two boxes left on the shelf during my last shopping trip, so signed up for Amazon's subscription service."
1183,B000GZSDSA,5,1212537600,my son loves these (they were recommended by a friend). they also hardly make a mess and dissolves easily
1184,B000GZSDSA,5,1212364800,"My daughter LOVES Baby Mum-Mums. We started giving them to her when she was about 7 months old, and now at almost 11 months old, she still eats at least one package a day. When she gets cranky during car or stroller rides, we just give her some mum-mum and she immediately stops crying and starts happily eating it. In fact, we got her to take her first steps by holding out some mum-mum, and she walked right towards it! I would recommend these to anyone with a baby. They really are the best, easiest snack ever!"
1185,B000GZSDSA,5,1208649600,"My 7 month old has been eating these for about 2 months and loves them; they disolve quickly, and has never had any problem with them."
1186,B000GZSDSA,5,1206835200,"After my son had mastered rice cereal, we could not get him to eat any other food.  Until we discovered Baby Mum-Mums!  They become soft quickly and are an ideal first food.<br /><br />Now that my son is 2 years old he still loves these crackers.  We have learned to bring a couple packages with us wherever we go.  They are perfect at restaurants...we give a package to my son to tide him over and keep him occupied while we are waiting for food to come to the table.  We bring an extra package just in case it takes a really long time for the food to come - best way to avoid a tantrum!"
1187,B000GZSDSA,5,1206662400,my daughter is 11 months.  she loves them!!! i couldnt live without them now!  no mess!  great snack!
1188,B000GZSDSA,5,1206316800,This is a great product and treat.  My son loves the fact that he can hold onto the biscuit and devour the rusk.  It has a similar dissolving consistency as gerber puffs but are great for some of my sons little friends who can't have gluten
1189,B000GZSDSA,5,1205971200,"I found these while I was visiting in Florida. My 9 month old loved them! They are easy to handle and melt in his mouth quickly, so no fear of getting a large piece stuck. He can break off a large piece, but he just sucks on it for a few seconds and it's soft enough to manage. Once back in MA, I couldn't find them in any of our grocery stores, so I ordered a case on Amazon. I have no doubt that he will eat all 12 boxes in the nex couple of months. We are tyotally sold on Mum-Mums!"
1190,B000GZSDSA,5,1205798400,"My family and I found these for our 8 month old grandbaby while on vacation. She loved them. They dissolve easily for teething babies and seem to taste very good. Good also once there teeth are in, as they can crunch and use their teeth to chew them up."
1191,B000GZSDSA,5,1198627200,This is gluten free.  My Grandson just loves them.  They sell out so fast at the store I can only get about 2-3 boxes at a time. With free shipping the price is better than the store price
1192,B000GZSDSA,5,1194393600,"When my daughter purchased this new item for my 8 month old grandson, little did she know she was finding his 58 year old Grammaw a wonderfully edible gluten free food also.Once I tasted them I immediately purchased 2 boxes for myself. I have Celiac Disease, as does my 5 yr. old granddaughter, and my grandson has not been able to tolerate gluten thus far either, so this is a treasure for all of us to find. They are difficult to find, and am so grateful to see them on Amazon! They certainly are not only for babies in this family. They are absolutly scrumptious with gluten free ready to use cheesecake filling spread on them, and I am going to try dipping them in melted semi sweet chocalate with a hint of peppermint extract, and then I will try a thin layer of peanut butter spread on them before dipping in semi sweet chocolate .... as far as I can tell .... there is no end to their use for me! I am so happy to find them on here, so that my 5 year old granddaughter can try them also!"
1193,B000GZSDSA,5,1193616000,"These ""cookies"" are the best for your little one that is learning to feed hand to mouth.  They are able to gum it around in their mouths and it dissolves pretty quickly.  I like them because they don't make a huge mess like biter biscuits or zwiebeck toast.  They are a great little snack and they don't go stale the day after you open the package.  If I could give them 6 stars, I would!"
1194,B000GZSDSA,5,1189728000,This is the greatest snack for your little one. My littl guy loves these because he can hold them easily and I don't worry because they melt when he puts them in his mouth. He loves them so much that when he sees the wrapper he comes crawling over smiling!
1195,B000GZSDSA,5,1183852800,"My 11 month old will go through a canister of gerber crunchies in a sitting.  We found these and she LOVES them, but doesn't go through them quite as quick.  I am anxious to try the veggie flavor with her.  Well worth it, and much more economical than Gerber Crunchies and healthier!"
1196,B000GZSDSA,5,1174089600,"Mum Mums were my son's favorite snack as a baby, so I was bummed to learn that my local grocers no longer stock them.  Thanks to Amazon for coming to my rescue!<br /><br />These are wonderful snacks for babies just learning to feed.  Because they are thin and dissolve in the mouth very quickly, babies are less likely to choke on them than the teething treats you typically see in stores.  I began feeding Mum Mums to both my son and my daughter within a few days of starting them on rice cereal and have never had them choke on one.  I also love that they are much less messy than other baby treats."
1197,B000GZSDSA,5,1172534400,"I found these crackers in the baby food aisle at my local supermarket while looking for a nutritious, easy to chew, snack for my 12 month old. Because my son had not cut many teeth, at that time, it was important to find something that he could chew easily.  Needless to say, my son is now 14 months old and completely addicted to them.  They are crispy, but dissolve easily in the mouth.  He loves the crunchy noise that the crackers make.  I whole-heartedly recommend this high quality product.  The crackers are well worth the price."
1198,B000GZSDSA,5,1170201600,These things are great! We found them while traveling in BC when our daughter was 5 months. She got the hang of them real quick with no choking! Now we take them everywhere with us. They are a great snack and great entertainment.
1199,B000GZSDSA,1,1309132800,"After reading all of the great reviews, I purchased these for my daughter.  Unfortunately I couldn't just buy one box, so I have way too many of these!  I like that they are light and safe for babies to eat.  However, the ones that I purchased were unflavored.  My 10 month old does not like them at all.  She'll play with them and then throw them on the floor.  This was a complete waste of money for me! Thankfully they weren't very expensive.  Maybe I would have had better luck if I had purchased these when she was 6 months old or if I had purchased a flavored brand.  I would advise you not to purchase these for babies older than 8 months.  If you do purchase them, you may want to consider the flavored ones."
1200,B000GZSDSA,2,1222387200,"My 8 months old loves this, but I just read the label this morning and discovered that it containes milk powder and it is made in China.  With all the recent recalls of milk products in China due to melamine contamination, I've decided not to give to my baby any more until I have evidence that it is safe.  Has anyone done any research on this topic?"
1201,B000GZSDSA,5,1240185600,"Mums are the absolute best.  I have not found any product that compares to it's food content and eatability.  Unlike many of the other ""teethers"" mum-mums do not get all messy and disintegrate in the baby's hand.  They rapidly dissolve in the baby's mouth -- no concern about choking.  I discovered them for my grandchild -- wish I had had them 30 years go!"
1202,B000GZSDSA,1,1233619200,These are made in china...not a good idea at all considering all the food saftey issues of late.  also i feel that it is wrong to buy food/agricultural products from another country (a politically hostile one at that) when our own poor farmers are having such a rough time making ends meet because all their work has been outsourced to these unsafe chinese farms.  there are many much safer and ethically sound alternatives to these snacks.
1203,B000GZSDSA,1,1297641600,"I bought this at Whole Foods so just naturally assumed they would be made in the US or Japan or somewhere reliable. NO. MADE IN CHINA. Very very sad and disappointed. My baby thought they were ok, but after a while got bored of it. I realized they were made in China half way through the box. Not letting baby eat any more of these tho and not buying it. I just don't trust ingesting anything made in China.<br />----------<br />*UPDATE*<br />----------<br />Whole Foods recalled this product from their shelves (at least the WF's around here). Can't buy this product anymore at WF."
1204,B000GZSDSA,5,1288742400,My eight month old daughter loves these things.  She can't get enough of them.
1205,B000GZSDSA,5,1241395200,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR BABIES! My daughter has oral motor issues but loves these.  They dissolve better than anything we've tried, no choking on chunks!  They are cheap and taste them yourself, yummy!  Great texture, large size, on a messy scale of 1-10, a 1 !  I won't touch gerber finger foods again!  Very low sugar also, my 3 yr old son even likes them!"
1206,B000GZSDSA,1,1243382400,I bought these because I could not find ANY teething biscuits anywhere around here. I was hoping they would do the same job but they don't come anywhere close to Gerber's product.  My daughter is six months old and although she likes them she bites off pieces with her teeth and I'm afraid that she'll choke. They don't dissolve quickly enough and were a waste of my money.
1207,B000GZSDSA,1,1225584000,I threw them all out.<br />They contain milk products and were manufactured in China.
1208,B000GZSDSA,1,1282694400,My son is 6 months old and I was so happy to find this product. I thought it would be like farley's rusks but it's more like a wafer. I tried it before giving it to him. It does not melt in the mouth on contact. This 'rusk' can easily break or be squished by a 6 month old. Thinking that my baby will have a better experience I gave it to him and he was biting on it like a teether and a small piece broke in his mouth. I quickly took it out as I could see that it was a hard piece and it failed to melt in the mouth on contact. I will return this so called rusk and get Farley's rusks instead.
1209,B000GZSDSA,1,1233100800,This rice rusk is made in China. I don't trust it since it has milk powder as one of ingredient.
1210,B001O023FK,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE.

1212,B001O023FK,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
1213,B001O023FK,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1214,B001O023FK,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
1215,B001O023FK,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
1216,B001O023FK,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
1217,B001O023FK,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
1218,B001O023FK,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
1219,B001O023FK,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
1220,B001O023FK,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
1221,B001O023FK,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
1222,B001O023FK,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
1223,B001O023FK,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
1224,B001O023FK,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
1225,B001O023FK,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
1226,B001O023FK,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
1227,B001O023FK,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
1228,B001O023FK,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
1229,B001O023FK,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1230,B001O023FK,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
1231,B001O023FK,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
1232,B001O023FK,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
1233,B001O023FK,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
1234,B001O023FK,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
1235,B001O023FK,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
1236,B001O023FK,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
1237,B001O023FK,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
1238,B001O023FK,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
1239,B001O023FK,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
1240,B001O023FK,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
1241,B001O023FK,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
1242,B001O023FK,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
1243,B001O023FK,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
1244,B001O023FK,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
1245,B001O023FK,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
1246,B001O023FK,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
1247,B001O023FK,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
1248,B001O023FK,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
1249,B001O023FK,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
1250,B001O023FK,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
1251,B001O023FK,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
1252,B001O023FK,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
1253,B001O023FK,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
1254,B001O023FK,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
1255,B001O023FK,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
1256,B001O023FK,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
1257,B001O023FK,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
1258,B001O023FK,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
1259,B001O023FK,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
1260,B001O023FK,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
1261,B001O023FK,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
1262,B001O023FK,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
1263,B001O023FK,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
1264,B001O023FK,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
1265,B001O023FK,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
1266,B001O023FK,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
1267,B001O023FK,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
1268,B001O023FK,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
1269,B001O023FK,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
1270,B001O023FK,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
1271,B001O023FK,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
1272,B001O023FK,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
1273,B001O023FK,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1274,B001O023FK,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
1275,B001O023FK,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
1276,B001O023FK,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
1277,B001O023FK,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
1278,B001O023FK,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
1279,B001O023FK,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
1280,B001O023FK,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
1281,B001O023FK,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
1282,B001O023FK,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
1283,B001O023FK,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
1284,B001O023FK,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
1285,B001O023FK,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
1286,B001O023FK,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
1287,B001O023FK,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
1288,B001O023FK,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
1289,B001O023FK,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
1290,B001O023FK,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
1291,B001O023FK,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
1292,B001O023FK,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
1293,B001O023FK,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
1294,B001O023FK,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
1295,B001O023FK,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
1296,B001O023FK,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
1297,B001O023FK,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
1298,B001O023FK,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
1299,B001O023FK,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
1300,B001O023FK,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
1301,B001O023FK,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
1302,B001O023FK,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
1303,B001O023FK,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
1304,B001O023FK,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
1305,B001O023FK,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
1306,B001O023FK,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
1307,B001O023FK,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
1308,B001O023FK,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
1309,B001O023FK,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
1310,B001O023FK,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
1311,B003CK0WLM,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
1312,B003CK0WLM,5,1252022400,"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
1313,B003CK0WLM,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
1314,B003CK0WLM,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1315,B003CK0WLM,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
1316,B003CK0WLM,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
1317,B003CK0WLM,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
1318,B003CK0WLM,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
1319,B003CK0WLM,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
1320,B003CK0WLM,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
1321,B003CK0WLM,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
1322,B003CK0WLM,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
1323,B003CK0WLM,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
1324,B003CK0WLM,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
1325,B003CK0WLM,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
1326,B003CK0WLM,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
1327,B003CK0WLM,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
1328,B003CK0WLM,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
1329,B003CK0WLM,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
1330,B003CK0WLM,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1331,B003CK0WLM,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
1332,B003CK0WLM,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
1333,B003CK0WLM,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
1334,B003CK0WLM,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
1335,B003CK0WLM,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
1336,B003CK0WLM,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
1337,B003CK0WLM,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
1338,B003CK0WLM,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
1339,B003CK0WLM,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
1340,B003CK0WLM,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
1341,B003CK0WLM,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
1342,B003CK0WLM,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
1343,B003CK0WLM,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
1344,B003CK0WLM,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
1345,B003CK0WLM,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
1346,B003CK0WLM,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
1347,B003CK0WLM,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
1348,B003CK0WLM,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
1349,B003CK0WLM,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
1350,B003CK0WLM,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
1351,B003CK0WLM,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
1352,B003CK0WLM,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
1353,B003CK0WLM,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
1354,B003CK0WLM,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
1355,B003CK0WLM,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
1356,B003CK0WLM,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
1357,B003CK0WLM,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
1358,B003CK0WLM,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
1359,B003CK0WLM,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
1360,B003CK0WLM,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
1361,B003CK0WLM,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
1362,B003CK0WLM,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
1363,B003CK0WLM,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
1364,B003CK0WLM,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
1365,B003CK0WLM,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
1366,B003CK0WLM,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
1367,B003CK0WLM,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
1368,B003CK0WLM,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
1369,B003CK0WLM,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
1370,B003CK0WLM,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
1371,B003CK0WLM,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
1372,B003CK0WLM,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
1373,B003CK0WLM,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
1374,B003CK0WLM,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1375,B003CK0WLM,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
1376,B003CK0WLM,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
1377,B003CK0WLM,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
1378,B003CK0WLM,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
1379,B003CK0WLM,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
1380,B003CK0WLM,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
1381,B003CK0WLM,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
1382,B003CK0WLM,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
1383,B003CK0WLM,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
1384,B003CK0WLM,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
1385,B003CK0WLM,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
1386,B003CK0WLM,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
1387,B003CK0WLM,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
1388,B003CK0WLM,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
1389,B003CK0WLM,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
1390,B003CK0WLM,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
1391,B003CK0WLM,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
1392,B003CK0WLM,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
1393,B003CK0WLM,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
1394,B003CK0WLM,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
1395,B003CK0WLM,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
1396,B003CK0WLM,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
1397,B003CK0WLM,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
1398,B003CK0WLM,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
1399,B003CK0WLM,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
1400,B003CK0WLM,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
1401,B003CK0WLM,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
1402,B003CK0WLM,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
1403,B003CK0WLM,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
1404,B003CK0WLM,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
1405,B003CK0WLM,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
1406,B003CK0WLM,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
1407,B003CK0WLM,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
1408,B003CK0WLM,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
1409,B003CK0WLM,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
1410,B003CK0WLM,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
1411,B003CK0WLM,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
1412,B000CQIDAG,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
1413,B000CQIDAG,5,1252022400,"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
1414,B000CQIDAG,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
1415,B000CQIDAG,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1416,B000CQIDAG,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
1417,B000CQIDAG,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
1418,B000CQIDAG,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
1419,B000CQIDAG,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
1420,B000CQIDAG,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
1421,B000CQIDAG,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
1422,B000CQIDAG,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
1423,B000CQIDAG,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
1424,B000CQIDAG,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
1425,B000CQIDAG,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
1426,B000CQIDAG,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
1427,B000CQIDAG,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
1428,B000CQIDAG,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
1429,B000CQIDAG,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
1430,B000CQIDAG,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
1431,B000CQIDAG,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1432,B000CQIDAG,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
1433,B000CQIDAG,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
1434,B000CQIDAG,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
1435,B000CQIDAG,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
1436,B000CQIDAG,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
1437,B000CQIDAG,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
1438,B000CQIDAG,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
1439,B000CQIDAG,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
1440,B000CQIDAG,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
1441,B000CQIDAG,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
1442,B000CQIDAG,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
1443,B000CQIDAG,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
1444,B000CQIDAG,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
1445,B000CQIDAG,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
1446,B000CQIDAG,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
1447,B000CQIDAG,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
1448,B000CQIDAG,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
1449,B000CQIDAG,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
1450,B000CQIDAG,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
1451,B000CQIDAG,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
1452,B000CQIDAG,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
1453,B000CQIDAG,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
1454,B000CQIDAG,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
1455,B000CQIDAG,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
1456,B000CQIDAG,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
1457,B000CQIDAG,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
1458,B000CQIDAG,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
1459,B000CQIDAG,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
1460,B000CQIDAG,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
1461,B000CQIDAG,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
1462,B000CQIDAG,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
1463,B000CQIDAG,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
1464,B000CQIDAG,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
1465,B000CQIDAG,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
1466,B000CQIDAG,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
1467,B000CQIDAG,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
1468,B000CQIDAG,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
1469,B000CQIDAG,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
1470,B000CQIDAG,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
1471,B000CQIDAG,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
1472,B000CQIDAG,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
1473,B000CQIDAG,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
1474,B000CQIDAG,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
1475,B000CQIDAG,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1476,B000CQIDAG,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
1477,B000CQIDAG,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
1478,B000CQIDAG,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
1479,B000CQIDAG,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
1480,B000CQIDAG,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
1481,B000CQIDAG,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
1482,B000CQIDAG,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
1483,B000CQIDAG,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
1484,B000CQIDAG,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
1485,B000CQIDAG,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
1486,B000CQIDAG,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
1487,B000CQIDAG,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
1488,B000CQIDAG,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
1489,B000CQIDAG,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
1490,B000CQIDAG,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
1491,B000CQIDAG,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
1492,B000CQIDAG,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
1493,B000CQIDAG,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
1494,B000CQIDAG,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
1495,B000CQIDAG,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
1496,B000CQIDAG,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
1497,B000CQIDAG,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
1498,B000CQIDAG,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
1499,B000CQIDAG,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
1500,B000CQIDAG,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
1501,B000CQIDAG,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
1502,B000CQIDAG,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
1503,B000CQIDAG,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
1504,B000CQIDAG,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
1505,B000CQIDAG,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
1506,B000CQIDAG,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
1507,B000CQIDAG,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
1508,B000CQIDAG,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
1509,B000CQIDAG,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
1510,B000CQIDAG,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
1511,B000CQIDAG,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
1512,B000CQIDAG,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
1513,B000P54HVS,5,1196640000,These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.<br /><br />I found them to be very sweet.<br />Makes a great snack or even dessert!
1514,B000P54HVS,5,1196640000,"The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."
1515,B000P54HVS,5,1194998400,Delicious as breakfast or a snack.<br />I bought these as an alternative to<br />non-organic cereal & milk for breakfast.<br /><br />They were a big hit & I do not have to keep<br />non-organic milk on hand.  I have not been<br />able to find organic powdered milk they will<br />drink.
1516,B000P54HVS,4,1193875200,"I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.  These make a great snack.  They are very sweet.  I cannot eat just one which is probably bad.  I think I am going to try the unfrosted variety to see if they are less sweet."
1517,B000P54HVS,4,1182902400,Toast it for 1 min. perfect breakfast. I wish it was a little less sweet though.
1518,B000P54HVS,2,1181779200,"Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan."
1519,B000P54HVS,3,1191196800,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
1520,B000P54HVS,2,1258848000,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
1521,B000P54HVS,2,1255132800,"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
1522,B000P54HVS,1,1328659200,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain!

1523,B000P54HVS,3,1237680000,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
1524,B000P54HVS,5,1176508800,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."

The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
1528,B000P54HVS,5,1198972800,"First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
1529,B000P54HVS,5,1189641600,"I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite."
1530,B000P54HVS,5,1164326400,These toaster pastries are very very good.These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts.You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack..
1531,B000P54HVS,5,1201910400,"I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND."
1532,B000P54HVS,5,1199923200,"These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them ""Purple Flurp"" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too)."
1533,B000P54HVS,5,1197244800,"I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry."
1534,B000P54HVS,4,1200614400,"Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much..."
1535,B000P54HVS,4,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry<br /><br />(hence 4 stars for this flavor, rather than 5)"
1536,B000P54HVS,5,1160179200,"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase."
1537,B000P54HVS,5,1169942400,"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor."
1538,B000P54HVS,4,1187136000,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
1539,B000P54HVS,5,1196640000,"I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes."
1540,B000P54HVS,4,1193961600,These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!
1541,B000P54HVS,5,1190937600,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries,Frosted Strawberry are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these.<br />Heated up with a glass of milk....HEAVEN."
1542,B000P54HVS,5,1160956800,"I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them."
1543,B000P54HVS,5,1155513600,"Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!"
1544,B000P54HVS,5,1238371200,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door.
1545,B000P54HVS,4,1209340800,"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box."
1546,B000P54HVS,5,1169769600,"The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste ""slightly"" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.<br /><br />Each pastry is 190 Calories<br /><br />40 Calories from Fat<br /><br />They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1547,B000P54HVS,5,1230422400,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure."
1548,B000P54HVS,5,1226534400,i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
1549,B000P54HVS,5,1204848000,"Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!"
1550,B000P54HVS,5,1202428800,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
1551,B000P54HVS,5,1200873600,"One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients."
1552,B000P54HVS,4,1189987200,"These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
1553,B000P54HVS,3,1181779200,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
1554,B000P54HVS,5,1329350400,"Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!"
1555,B000P54HVS,5,1283299200,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
1556,B000P54HVS,5,1272499200,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
1557,B000P54HVS,5,1243209600,"My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard ""pop-tarts"", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement. Well folks here it is, my kids eat them all the time, they make a perfect snack that is not junk. I wish more variety packages were available. I absolutely reccomend this product in all flavors."
1558,B000P54HVS,5,1237248000,these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry
1559,B000P54HVS,5,1236124800,My wife & mom really like these.  They are really good & replace the breakfast rush meal
1560,B000P54HVS,4,1221350400,"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!"
1561,B000P54HVS,5,1219190400,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
1562,B000P54HVS,5,1215820800,"I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!"
1563,B000P54HVS,5,1206921600,"My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."
1564,B000P54HVS,5,1190937600,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Apple Cinnamon are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these."

1566,B000P54HVS,5,1182297600,"Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second. Also tasty right out of the package for an on-the-go snack."
1567,B000P54HVS,4,1174867200,"a little dry, but given that they're pretty healthy (all things considered), i'm willing to forgive..."
1568,B000P54HVS,5,1172102400,"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."

1570,B000P54HVS,4,1168646400,It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
1571,B000P54HVS,5,1187827200,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run.  They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
1572,B000P54HVS,5,1181260800,Recommended.  Good price when bought in bulk.
1573,B000P54HVS,5,1177804800,These are delicious! They are much better and much better for you and the planet than more processed alternatives.
1574,B000P54HVS,5,1214438400,"These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
1575,B000P54HVS,5,1350518400,"Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.  Getting them from Amazon is even better, because they are much cheaper.  Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon."
1576,B000P54HVS,4,1347926400,"We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."
1577,B000P54HVS,5,1344556800,"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support."
1578,B000P54HVS,5,1343347200,"I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of ""food,"" is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more."
1579,B000P54HVS,5,1342310400,"First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a ""healthy"" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation."
1580,B000P54HVS,5,1340755200,"What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth."
1581,B000P54HVS,5,1337472000,This is a great price for a healthy food for my kids!  Like the convenience of purchasing and scheduling deliveries when needed.
1582,B000P54HVS,5,1318982400,"My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat."
1583,B000P54HVS,5,1316736000,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
1584,B000P54HVS,5,1302134400,I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.  Amazon has a lower price than my local grocers.
1585,B000P54HVS,4,1299110400,"I like these, paltry on the frosting! Can see right through it, not just in one spot, all of it."
1586,B000P54HVS,5,1298246400,"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
1587,B000P54HVS,4,1297814400,"The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly."
1588,B000P54HVS,5,1294358400,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
1589,B000P54HVS,5,1291939200,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
1590,B000P54HVS,5,1288915200,"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"
1591,B000P54HVS,5,1284681600,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
1592,B000P54HVS,5,1282521600,These are the best toaster pasties we have had. Nature's Path has the best flavors and ingredients and at a good price - a good deal and good for you all around. I purchase them over and over. My husband loves them. Everyone that tries them loves them. And the best part is they are organic too!
1593,B000P54HVS,5,1277596800,"Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets."
1594,B000P54HVS,4,1276732800,organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.
1595,B000P54HVS,3,1275782400,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
1596,B000P54HVS,5,1274054400,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
1597,B000P54HVS,5,1269993600,"I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or ""pomegran"" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!"
1598,B000P54HVS,5,1268438400,"If you like pop tarts these taste great and are ""healthy"" (well as healthy as a sweet, frosted pop tart can get anyway). If you are going to buy pop tarts for your kids, spend the extra money and buy these,"
1599,B000P54HVS,5,1267056000,"I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good. Good flavor, nice quick and easy snack."
1600,B000P54HVS,5,1265414400,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
1601,B000P54HVS,5,1261872000,A good breakfast or snack option for kids on the go- and without all the icky additives.  We all like them!  Buy them with the Subscribe and Save and they are a great deal!
1602,B000P54HVS,5,1260835200,These are great.  Loved em.  My only complaint I guess would be the price here.  I bought a 32 count box of these at Costco for only 7.99.  You could buy the same quantity for about half the cost there vs here.
1603,B000P54HVS,5,1253577600,"I prefer natural foods with minimal processing, and we are kosher. This is an amazing product. Excellent for any time of the day, good for snacks, or along with breakfast. My kids love them, and I kind of like them too."
1604,B000P54HVS,5,1245888000,"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community."
1605,B000P54HVS,4,1244505600,I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.
1606,B000P54HVS,5,1240012800,"These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up."
1607,B000P54HVS,4,1228521600,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
1608,B000P54HVS,5,1223251200,Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type. Convenient when they need a quick breakfast or after school snack. We buy the strawberry and blueberry often.
1609,B000P54HVS,3,1219622400,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories.  A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
1610,B000P54HVS,5,1210377600,My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :)
1611,B000P54HVS,4,1208649600,"With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children."
1612,B000P54HVS,5,1208131200,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
1613,B000P54HVS,3,1202169600,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
1614,B00503DOWS,5,1311638400,"I'm no expert on nutrition, but this bar claims it has all kinds of good stuff and does not have bad stuff, and I have no information to the contrary - the ingredients do sound good. And, at 190 calories and that it tastes delicious, works for me. The oats, raisins and walnuts dominate the taste, in a chewy way."
1615,B00503DOWS,4,1311552000,"These bars taste very good and are made from quality ingredients that are all natural. If you don't like snack bars because they're too hard or chewy, give this a try. It's moist and taste more like an oatmeal raisin cookie than a traditional granola bar. It's also shaped like a cookie (or hamburger patty), being roundish rather than rectangular. It's got a good mouth-feel and chewy consistency, but is not overly chewy. I can clearly taste the walnuts, oats, pumpkin spice, and raisins in here, though some of the other ingredients listed are undetectable, like organic agave and coconut sugar.<br /><br />My only complaint is that each serving is quite small and calorically-dense. The box contains 5 individually wrapped snacks. Each 1.41oz bar fits on a credit card and is really comparable to a same-sized cookie at 190 calories each, 80 of which is from fat. Each ""cookie"" contains 2g of dietary fiber (10% of your daily intake) and 350mg of heart-protecting omega-3 fatty acid. Health officials (from WHO and US Dept of Health) recommend anywhere from 1-3g of omega-3 per day for adults for cardiovascular benefits.<br /><br />From the box: 1.5g saturated fat (8%), 140mg sodium (6%), 15mg cholesterol (6%) Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), calcium (2%), iron (4%).<br /><br />Additionally, the box is made of 100% recycled paperboard and printed with soy ink."
1616,B00503DOWS,4,1311552000,"I'm not accustomed to chewy granola bars.  These were alittle to chewy for my taste.  But they do have a nice flavor.<br /><br />I was glad to see ""highlighted"" in the ingredients - Coconut sugar and Organic eggs, walnut & coconut.  They also state that the ingredients I just mentioned are processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy & milk.  This doesn't affect me but I'm sure could be useful to those allergic to nuts."
1617,B00503DOWS,5,1313366400,"Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Bars are the best gluten free cookie bars that we've found. My husband is on a gluten free diet. It's very difficult to find good tasting commercially made cookies and cakes. So often the products have a very dry texture and bland taste. I ate one of the Pamela's bars too, and had to stop from having another. So far, I've not found the Pamela's brand of products near our home, but will be making some calls to find a retailer in my vicinity."
1618,B00503DOWS,4,1312329600,"You can read about all the positives of this product yourself - the 350mg Omerga 3 fatty acids, the whole grains, the zero trans fats, and the wheat free, gluten free, and dairy free characteristics. All that is fine, but what about the taste? No matter how wonderful the content, taste is the ultimate arbiter, especially when giving these to your kids.<br /><br />As one who's been eating, tasting, and testing foods for well over fifty years, I've determined that Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bars have what it takes to pass the taste test. The touch of spice is tasty without being overwhelming, and the texture is varied and interesting. These bars do satisfy though for me the 3 inch length isn't quite enough so I eat them in pairs.<br /><br />Also observed:<br /><br />You'll get your hands a little sticky so don't type and eat.<br />The wrapper is much larger than the bar warrants. Maybe the size is necessary to fit all the product information on.<br />The shape is uneven making it look more like a home made item.<br /><br />Final verdict - Pamela's is a winner."
1619,B00503DOWS,5,1312243200,"If you are looking for a quick breakfast or a tasty snack you can't go wrong with the ""Whenever Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Bars."" They are fairly small and about the size of your palm. They taste a bit like a moist oatmeal cookie but with more interesting flavors. The walnuts are fresh and crunchy and the raisins add a little more sweetness. These bars have interesting ingredients like coconut sugar, chia seeds and organic agave. These bars are good on the go...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1620,B00503DOWS,2,1312156800,"If you are looking for squished, slightly dry snack bread...this is great! It's as if your health conscious auntie made a loaf of walnut raisin bread that didn't rise and decided to pass it off as a cookie.<br /><br />Honestly, if you have dietary restrictions that keep you from eating wheat or dairy or gluten, this IS really good and probably warrants a 3 1/2 to 4 star review...for the rest of us ""Meh!"" is a fine review.<br /><br />2g of protein does not make for a good snack bar & 2g of fiber doesn't either. It IS all natural but so's particle board.<br /><br />Best to avoid unless you have dietary restrictions...but always have liquid refreshment handy."
1621,B00503DOWS,4,1311811200,"I like to think of myself as something of a ""snack bar"" connoisseur.  I've tried chewy, crunchy, peanutty, fruity, salty, sweet, granola, chocolate...you name it.  So I was excited to see a new type of bar on the market.  I don't know exactly what a ""whenever bar"" is - does that imply that other types of bars can only be eaten at certain times? - but the end result is a slightly unusual product that tastes good.<br /><br />The shape is unusual - they are short and wide - but the taste is good (a nice combination of salty and sweet) and the texture is very chewy, which I prefer to crunchy.  If you have to have crunch in your snack bars, I don't think you will like these much.  They are more filling than I expected, too.<br /><br />I've not seen these in stores, but if you find them and you're in the market for some new chewy snack bars, I'd say give them a try."
1622,B00503DOWS,4,1311724800,"The top part of the wrapper advertises, ""Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free, Non-Dairy"" and that it's good whenever. In the spirit of whenever I decided to try a bar as my breakfast; the question I had was would one bar provide sufficient nutrition to carry me to lunch without getting hungry mid-morning. I can report that it did just that; I didn't even think about food until after 12 PM. So I would count that as a success.<br /><br />In all fairness I must admit that my lifestyle that morning was much less than vigorous and active and one who is engaging in an active lifestyle with much physical exertion will probably need to supplement one bar.<br /><br />The bar is rather soft and chewy and has a fruity flavor that reminded me of dates; I checked and there are no dates listed so I'm not sure what I tasted. The list of ingredients starts with Gluten-Free Oats with Organic Agave as the second ingredient; the agave is also known as the Century Plant. The third ingredient is a rice blend which includes some rice flours, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Walnuts were pretty far down the list and I don't recall encountering any chunks of walnuts. There was, however, a warning for people with allergies that the product was processed on equipment that makes other products that use peanuts and other tree nuts, soy and milk.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 15 mg of cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium, 2 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.<br /><br />I enjoyed my bar with a cup of coffee and found it sustained me all morning. It is not a cookie or a particularly sweet treat but it is a tasty and convenient food. The package is easy to open if you pinch the wrapper on the front and back and pull it apart."
1623,B00503DOWS,3,1311724800,"Pamela's Gluten Free Whenever Bars are not bad for a quick bite on the go, but may leave you feeling a little unsatisfied and hollow.<br /><br />Oat Raisin Walnut Spice is an ok flavor combo- soft, chewy and pretty tasty, reminds you of oatmeal cookies- but there's more oats than anything else. Wheat free, gluten-free and non-dairy, they're good for a whenever snack- just as advertised. The box indicates there may be traces of soy due to the manufacturing process.<br /><br />The energy boost is a little light, with 24 g carbs per 40 g bar. That's not much better than a piece of fruit.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in these in that they're a bit on the small side and the product description is misleading: the box only contains five bars, not six. They're ok, but as I said in my other reviewer I'd still take a Clif bar over these."

They have a wonderful spice-cake flavor & consistency that's augmented by a delightful mix of oats, raisins and walnuts. Everything is natural-no junk or fillers. These lightly sweetened bars are great with coffee, tea or even the ever popular tall glass of cold milk. A great, healthy between meal snack that can be enjoyed anytime of day. They're individually wrapped, so they can be taken along just about anywhere. Great for the kids lunch box/bag so that you'll be confident at least one snack each day is a healthy one!"

Then I looked on the back of the package.<br /><br />Carbs.  TONS and TONS of carbs.  Now, I admit I am biased since I have Type C Diabetes.  But it is because of my diabetes that I check labels.  Pamela's may SAY that these bars are healthy, and the ingredients listed are pretty good -- but it was the carbs and sugar contents of each bar that deterred me from being able to fully enjoy my sample.<br /><br />Size.  Pamela's Products Whenever Bars are small.  Very, very small.  The bar itself is chewy and tastes great.  I don't agree that it would keep a person from being hungry or that it could be used as a meal.  Did I mention that the bar was tiny?<br /><br />Price.  These babies are expensive.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the couple of bites I was able to experience, the excess of carbs in each tiny bar and the expensive retail price will definitely keep me from buying more.<br /><br />Natalie S."
1628,B00503DOWS,5,1324944000,"I love these bars! Very moist, just enough hint of spice to remind me of a spice cake. The bars are moist, the nuts crunchy, the raisins, moist and plentiful. Not a low carb protein bar, but gluten free, and dairy free. Great snack bar. I would recommend these bars to everyone, not just people who can't have gluten."
1629,B00503DOWS,2,1323043200,"I grow tired of products that claim to be healthy and the WHENEVER BARS are no exception. When you put ingredients like oatmeal, walnuts and raisins into a food, it certainly gives the illusion that you're consuming something ""healthy,"" right? But when you look at the ingredients list and nutritional info of this OAT RAISIN WALNUT SPICE bar, the reality hits you square between the eyeballs--this is NOT good for you. Although one tiny bar contains only 100 calories, it's mostly carbohydrates that will spike your blood sugar and insulin levels. That's not very good for your body if you're attempting to eat healthy. While I suppose this product is better than most of the carbage sold in stores these days, it's not doing you any favors if you are consuming it as a means to lose weight or improve your health. Of course, if you don't care about either one of those things, then eat up. But if you want to shed pounds and ward off chronic disease, then run away, run FAR away from this product."

1631,B00503DOWS,4,1321488000,"I'm not intolerant to gluten, but I do keep an eye out for healthy snack foods. These oat raisin walnut spice bars have an unusual consistency, rather like fruit cake, but they sure taste better than fruitcake! They're not overly sweet, and it's actually possible to detect the flavors of oats, raisins, walnuts, and spice (mainly cinnamon), and they go well with a nice, hot cup of tea."
1632,B00503DOWS,3,1313712000,"Before I go into the thrashing of ingredients, I must admit these taste *really good*. They smell good too, when you first open them. Like actual oatmeal raisin cookies! The texture is nice and soft, with a walnut crunch. These are higher quality bars than most. Unlike most snack bars, they don't leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth afterwards. I do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, but I did enjoy eating one of these bars for testing. I actually ate the entire thing and was surprised at what a quality product it was. (Heated in the microwave--out of the wrapper-for a few seconds, it was almost like a cookie straight out of the oven!)<br /><br />Having said that; they have 24 grams of carbohydrates per bar and 2 grams of fiber. I was surprised that they only had 9 g of sugars considering the second ingredient (agave) is the equivalent to corn syrup. Yes yes I know, ""It's natural!"" But look and see how it's processed, it's no different. One has a health label and the other doesn't. For those watching their sugars, they are the same and should be noted.<br /><br />If you are on a gluten-free diet because of health reasons, you will really enjoy these bars! If you are gluten free and also sugar-free, these aren't going to be a regular item for you. If you want a delicious snack bar that tastes pretty close to homemade, and you don't label your eating style, then you will like these bars! One bar is filling and delicious. Soft raisins and crunchy walnuts, if you are going to buy ANY snack bars, these are worth the money over other grocery store products!"
1633,B00503DOWS,4,1315958400,"Pamela's products have a long gluten free history and some are better than others like everything else. The reviews here run the gammut from great to disappointing. Too often I think people don't manage there expectations when they are buying a product where all the nutrional information is available. These bars are what they are, don't buy them if you want something vegan or low in sugar. Based on what's in the bar they're an ok, relatively healthy snack. My kids eat them if they're hungry but would likely reach for something less healthy given a choice. These aren't supermarket snack bars, I and they can deal with that. They're not hand baked by elves either. Check out the nutritional info provided and move along if they're not what you're looking for..."
1634,B00503DOWS,2,1314230400,"Within our family, my husband has diabetic neuropathy, one of us is a vegetarian(that would be me), and one of us is a Vegan.<br />This product might please others, who are not so particular, or who have different taste buds, but here is how it went with us: 1) My huaband thought they tasted ""horrible"". 2) I didn't think the colorie count and ingredients were worth incorporating into my diet daily or otherwise, and 3)my Vegan son could not even try them because, although they are touted as healthy, due to a few ingredients which were not necessary to add, they are NOT Vegan. Come on, even some varieties of Pop Tarts are Vegan at this point, not that I am saying Pop Tarts are the way to go.<br />Just my thoughts.<br />Incidentally, one of my children with autism took one look at the packaging and threw the bar and the package away. He is non verbal, but I count that as 4)one more opinion, possibly more of an aethestic nature, to take note of.<br />Sorry, Pamela's Products Whenever Bars in Oatmeal Raisin Spice...you sounded nifty but you just were not our cup of tea. Improvements could be made I bet!"
1635,B00503DOWS,2,1313366400,"Pamela's cookies have long been the gold-standard for gluten-free treats and their chocolate-y goodness has gotten me through many a sad gluten-free day. When I saw these bars I snatched them up: sometimes you want a snack and a girl can eat only so many cookies and still keep her figure. Sadly, these tasteless, not-very-good-for-you bars fall short of the mark.<br /><br />TASTE: Blah. Sort of a raisin-studded sawdust is how I would describe it.<br /><br />NUTRITION: Also blah. There's some token chia, but the fiber, vitamin and mineral content is lacking. Plus the calorie count is high for such a tiny bar.<br /><br />THE SUGGESTED REMEDY: More spice (a tad more nutmeg and a dash of cardamon perhaps), swap out the raisins for cherries, increase the size of the bar and more fiber please.<br /><br />THE GRADE: C-<br /><br />It ain't worth the price my fellow gluten-freers. The search continues!"
1636,B00503DOWS,3,1311638400,"Wheat-free! Gluten-free! Non-dairy! Right off the bat, these bars sound like they're some pretty healthy snacks, and who can resist the taste of raisins and walnuts? I opened my box as soon as I got it in the mail, and upon opening the pack...was disappointed. These things are tiny! They're about the size of your standard credit card or driver's license, and gone in two bites. If you've ever had the Grandma's Cookies from a vending machine, they're just a little smaller than those, and taste similar to the oatmeal raisin ones, only these have walnuts.<br /><br />Sure these taste really good, but when you look at the nutrition values, it's hard to justify spending so much for a box of 6 of these, especially when there are better snack options out there. 190 calories? Ugh. 15mg of cholesterol? Ouch. I've had protein bars with much more nutrition, and less calories, that cost a fraction of what these do. I guess the key selling point of these Whenever bars is that they're non-dairy and gluten-free, but these seem like yet another product to jump on the 'healthy' bandwagon, with an inflated price."
1637,B00503DOWS,2,1334793600,"As a sufferer of Celiac Disease, I'm always looking for a gluten free snack.  Pamela's products are often a good choice for me.  These Oat Raisin Walnut Spice ""Whenever Bars"" provide a ""gluten free, wheat free, dairy free"" snack made with whole grains and sweetened with agave and coconut.  They are surprising nutty, a real bonus, nor do they skimp on the raisins--not so much a bonus to my palette, but they are large and whole so that I could pick them out easily.  These bars are also highly spicy, which I found pleasant, but which might be a problem for some people.  Over all, for me, the taste was very good, and the texture did not have the sandy feel often found in gluten free sweets.  Taste and texture both rate five stars<br /><br />On the negative size is the combination of price, size and carbs.  The latter is a personal preference, and not one that everyone will worry about.  As a Type 2 Diabetic, I have to eat carbs responsibly, and the 24 grams of carbs in this small bar (balanced by only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of dietary fiber) does not make it worth it for me.<br /><br />The size and price elements will, I think, effect every consumer.  They are considerably smaller than other snack bars and at an average of just under $4 for a box of 5 bars, considerably more expensive.  I would recommend LARAbars as an overall better alternative."
1638,B00503DOWS,4,1330128000,"I have tried many gluten-free products, and many are dry, dense, or not that appetizing.  Therefore I didn't expect much from these, but I needed some emergency rations for a trip.  I was really surprised at how much they tasted like a soft, moist oatmeal cookie!  I found them delicious.  I would not say it is particularly healthy, given how much fat (9 g), calories (180) and sugars (9g) are in a ""bar"" that is pretty much the size of a cookie, but for those of us who need a safe snack on-the-go or a makeshift breakfast, I recommend these for flavor.  2g protein, 2g fiber, 24g carbohydrate.  Not vegan (contain eggs) but dairy-free (processed on equipment that also makes products containing milk among other allergens, but doesn't list wheat/gluten as a possible contaminant)."
1639,B00503DOWS,5,1320019200,"In looking for healthy snacks to make it through the afternoon at work, these are by far my favorite.  Not only are they full of healthy ingredients, without containing any wheat, gluten or Dairy, they taste great without being hard as a rock or chalky like so many other bars!  If you didn't know they were good for you, you would swear they were a homemade treat full of fat and sugar. With only 180 calories a bar, you can't go wrong with these tasty treats."
1640,B00503DOWS,5,1319932800,"My family has gone absolutely NUTS for these bars. Ever since I bought the first boxes as a Gold Box deal, they will not touch the other bars (Oskri's Turkish Delight & Cashew bars and Cascadian Farms Fruit & Nut bars - I had bought lots as they were going through them regularly). The other bars are great, but these are in a whole different class - they are like eating the best oatmeal raisin cookie ever (the only thing that would make them even better would be fresh from the oven!).<br />The price is excellent and these are so healthy that I am happy to buy as many as the family will eat. I have not tried the other Pamela's products, but would venture to guess that they are equally as wonderful."
1641,B00503DOWS,5,1317254400,I like that you can eat these bars without immediately feeling that you need to drink something. They are moister than most energy bars I've tried and the walnuts add a great flavor and crunch. The sweetness level seems right too (9 out of 40 grams). The packaging is a bit misleading as the bar itself is only a bit more than half the length of the pouch. All in all a tasty morsel especially if you like walnuts.
1642,B00503DOWS,5,1316563200,Really tasty. Unusual and good flavor. Excellent consistency. Wider bars than most.  Soft but not crumbly. Loved these!  Wish they came more to a box.
1643,B00503DOWS,3,1316044800,"I thought these were good snack bars.  For a ""meal replacement"" I would suggest Clif bars.  The price is about the same.  These are gluten free... but that is not something I care about personally.  I doubt I would buy these given the price."
1644,B00503DOWS,3,1316044800,"Upon receiving this item I went in thinking these bars would be bland, I was so pleasantly surprised because they were delicious. They are gluten free which is good however if you read the ingredients they are full of sugar and carbohydrates which for someone wanting to watch their weight or having certain medical conditions they may want to avoid."
1645,B00503DOWS,3,1315958400,"If you need or want gluten free, dairy free, or both, this is a delicious bar.  But the real nutrition isn't really there; not much fiber or protein."
1646,B00503DOWS,5,1315785600,"Having tried almost every type of bar for portable meals or snacks, I was quite pleasantly surprised at how tasty and delicious these Whenever Bars are. I tried the Oat Raisin Walnut Spice and the bars are studded with goodies and nicely spiced. I went back for seconds the first time I tried them. Traditional granola bars are sometimes too hard to chew or too sugary or seem to have mysterious filler ingredients. It's easy to see what's in these bars. If you like a chewy oatmeal cookie type consistency, you'll like these, too! Highly recommend. They are not as big and dense as the Quaker chewy breakfast bars, but are a very nice size and easy to eat. These bars are on my shopping list now!"
1647,B00503DOWS,4,1315180800,"These bars are a tasty snack.  The taste is like a dry carrot cake.  It is a little chewy, and has a nice texture, with nuts and raisins.  It is surprisingly high in calories, 180 for each bar."
1648,B00503DOWS,5,1314835200,"I absolutely love these. And I'm not particularly a fan of either oatmeal, walnuts, or raisins. They're that good, especially with a glass of cold milk.<br /><br />They're chewy, with a great consistency. They're sweet, without being cloying: you can taste the spice in them (cinnamon? allspice?), and it nicely complements the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these aren't really ""healthy"" - or, the macronutrients and calories are comparable to a candy bar. Very high in simple carbohydrates, very calorically dense. They'd be ideal for hiking, running, cycling, etc. They're not very big, and definitely pricey for their size, but I think they're definitely"
1649,B00503DOWS,5,1314230400,"These appear to be made from good ingredients.  They have a nice taste.  They are a healthy snack for use any time you need a snack, which for me is several times a  day.  The size of the bar is slightly small, but very delicious and healthy."
1650,B00503DOWS,4,1314230400,"Most snack bars are wheat based and therefore, cannot be eaten by people with a glueten free diet.  These bars have no glueten (wheat) in them, so it fills the needs of this group of people. (Although they are not vegetarian/vegan)<br /><br />As for the important taste and texture, these bars excell.  While most snack bars tend to be dense and heavy, these do not sit in your stomach like a lead ball.  They are not light a fluffy, they are what I would call substantial.  The flavour is also very good.  Not over spiced but definitely not bland or dull.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these for people on the go who want a more healthy on the go snack."
1651,B00503DOWS,4,1314230400,"Eating these, I felt much more like I was enjoying a nicely balanced cookie instead of a healthy bar-type snack. With other brand bars, I often find them too chewy (too many oats, etc) and a little too hard. These had a nice balance of ingredients so it's more like biting into a cookie instead of a granola bar. Not too chewy, not too dense, good flavor. The only issue for me is it comes out of the package a little too moist. It felt like biting into a somewhat soggy cookie, or a cookie that had briefly fallen in a glass of water and left for a few hours to dry. It was moister than any other packaged cookie or bar that I've tried. That was a major turnoff for me, but two family members I shared this product with made no mention of that and rather enjoyed these bars and their level of moistness very much, so it might just be me."
1652,B00503DOWS,4,1313625600,"PROS<br /><br />- great tasting product<br />- portion size is correct for its food group<br />- handy snack to carry in your purse, bag, or backpack<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- only 6 bars per package<br />- non-recyclable wrappers<br />- not enough food for a replacement meal; you'll have to eat something else with it for a complete meal<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />This is overall a very tasty product. This is a perfect item to include in lunchboxes or to pack for camping and hiking trips. It would be a good energy snack to have after a workout at the gym. I personally prefer a crunchier granola bar, but if you like your granola bars to be chewy, you will enjoy this very natural tasting snack."
1653,B00503DOWS,4,1313625600,"Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut bar was well-described as a ""cookie"" by a fellow reviewer.  We would only add that they resemble a healthier treat without a crunch.  Pamela's Product comes in a kid-size portion, which may not be enough for some; and they are very soft--and easily crushed if left in a pocket or bag.  See the photo we uploaded...straight from the package, one corner was bent easily, while another broke in pieces.<br /><br />However, besides being tasty, these Whenever Bars are gladly wheat-free, non-dairy, and offer nutrients that most cookies lack."
1654,B00503DOWS,5,1313625600,"These ""Whenever Bars"" are great. They are all natural, low in sugars and full of protein and fiber and healthy oils. Best of all, my young son LOVES LOVES LOVES them. And I feel good about giving them to him because they're all natural with only natural flavorings and ingredients. I'll definitely be buying more, and trying more flavors. Thanks for offering these at a fair price."
1655,B00503DOWS,3,1313625600,"I used to have to eat gluten-free because of a histamine reaction I got from consuming wheat, I always enjoyed Pamela's Products to help make it easier to eat happy.  I am sad to say that this bar is a huge let down: very small, too low in fiber and protein, and very high in calories for its size.<br /><br />I understand that gluten-free food is not going to taste the same as their wheat-filled counterparts, but this really missed the mark.  With almost 200 calories, it should contain more protein and fiber than it does.  Add to its disappointing nutrition numbers its texture, so gummy and sticky that it is not enjoyable or convenient.  You will need a sink or wet nap for your hands afterwards.  I think I would wave away much of my scrutiny if this was just marketed as an extra chewy cookie, since that is what it is. The marketing copy I saw when ordering this off Amazon Vine was ""A Satisfying Snack Food WHENEVER you want!""  I think that is a bit misleading since its stats are very close to most the Pamela's Cookies, the PB cookies even have more protein that these Whenever Bars.  As a healthy sweet treat, these are fine, as a nutritious snack between meals -- I will pass."
1656,B00503DOWS,3,1313625600,"These oat raisin bars taste like oatmeal cookies.  To me, they are tasty.  Not too sure how healthy they are, and they are pretty expensive.  I'd buy a box of oatmeal cookies instead, but I'm not concerned about the gluten-free issue."
1657,B00503DOWS,5,1313625600,"Pamela's ""Whenever Bars: Oat Raisin Walnut Spice"" taste just like an oatmeal-raisin cookie and are deceptively filling for their small size.  In fact, the first time I had one, I scarfed it right down and probably didn't even chew enough, so I chased it with a second, along with a cup of coffee, and in about five minutes after everything got in my stomach, I felt like I'd eaten a plate of big pancakes.  So that was the wrong way to go about enjoying a Whenever Bar.  If you chew properly instead of eating as though you're a starving mastiff, ONE Whenever Bar is enough for one ""sitting.""  And these are a good option for when you're out and about, to keep your hands out of the candy bars or cookies at your nearest gas station.  You get some nutrition in return for your calories with these, instead of filling your internal gas tank with sugar and fat.  And like I said, they taste just like a regular oatmeal-raisin cookie, so it feels like you're being really indulgent, with these bars."
1658,B00503DOWS,5,1313539200,"I recently discovered that I'm gluten sensitive, and have been delighted to discover Pamela's products. I have been using the baking mix and now these, which are delicious!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. These resemble an oatmeal cookie and are not obviously gluten free by the taste or texture.<br />2. Delicious!<br />3. Healthy ingredients (e.g., w/o strange additives)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. A lot of calories in that one cookie (190). Though I think that is typical of similar snack products.<br /><br />For me, these are primarily in the same food niche as LaraBars, a snack for when I don't have time for a proper meal. LaraBars have an even shorter ingredient list, but they have the strange gooey consistency. (They are roughly the same in calories.)<br /><br />I will get these again -- they're a tasty and healthy snack."
1659,B00503DOWS,5,1313539200,"I have tried just about every Energy bar, and by far this is the tastiest.<br />That said, this is not called a Energy Bar.<br /><br />I guess there a tasty healthy little bar. If your hungry and on the go, and need to grab something that is healthy this is it.<br /><br />There NOY dry, and these are not ground up cardboard seeds, as most of the other bars are.<br />The nuts seem to be whole. I taste allot of whole Walnuts,raisins in these etc.<br />Its not hard on your teeth.<br /><br />The only draw back that I don't like is, there is Organic ""Agave"" in it, as the 3rd ing.<br />A while ago Agave was sold to us that it was a healthy type of sugar.<br />From what I have been reading, it is the same as , High fruitose corn syrup!Which I do not eat.<br />Maybe someone else here knows more about it then I do!<br /><br />As I said I don't like the idea there is Agave in this (although better then Soy). If there was not any, I would,and still might buy these to keep in my Car/ Purse.<br />They are good, and are Healthy, and look pretty much like the picture on the box.<br />These are not huge, but I think there satisifing, and filled me up."
1660,B00503DOWS,3,1313452800,"Agave is hyped up to be this great sweetener, but actually simply coconut sugar would be a much better choice.  Anyway, this had a flavor very reminiscent of oatmeal cookies, and I did enjoy one with a cup of coffee for the first taste test.  Next time I packed one in my purse, and I liked it but not as much without the coffee to help wash it down.  They are quite small for the price and calories.  Unfortunately, anything gluten-free seems to get an inflated price these days.  I hope in the future that trend will reverse."
1661,B00503DOWS,4,1313366400,"Pamela's Whenever Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Bars taste great, but make sure to check the nutritional facts if you like to watch what you eat:<br />Calories 190<br />Calories from fat 80<br />Total Fat 9g (13%)<br />- Saturated Fat 1.5g (8%)<br />Cholesterol 15mg (6%)<br />Sodium 140mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 24g (8%)<br />- Dietary Fiber 2g (10%)<br />- Sugars 9g<br />Protein 2g<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />The bars tasted great and weren't dry at all.  In fact, they reminded me more of chewy cookies or cereal bars.  They're pretty dense and I found them to be a pretty good size for a quick snack.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend them because I liked the taste and that they don't contain high fructose corn syrup.  However, they don't pack much in terms of vitamins or minerals so these would be more for quick pick-me-up snacks rather than meal alternatives."
1662,B00503DOWS,4,1313280000,"These bars, to me, taste like a moist, soft oatmeal cookie. Oats, raisins, nuts, and a nice spice note. Considering all the things they're not (wheat free, gluten free, non-dairy) these are really tasty. Many of the moist healthy bars I've tried are really sticky, but not these. For me they're not too sticky, and just the right amount of chewiness and sweetness. The added chia seeds were a bit of a distraction, but not enough to ruin the experience. Overall, I like them well enough to purchase them, and at less than 80 cents per bar, a not too extravagant treat."
1663,B00503DOWS,4,1313193600,"These bars taste very good, like oatmeal raisin cookies.  My two toddlers also loved the bar, which is not all that surprising because it is very sweet (and a little sticky).  While gluten-free, be forewarned that it does contain eggs so it's not safe for all allergies."
1664,B00503DOWS,3,1313107200,"Tasty little snacks, sweeter than a power bar but not anything like a candy bar, good enough to toss into your kid's lunch but won't exactly fill them up."
1665,B00503DOWS,4,1313107200,"Whether looking for a non-dairy and gluten-free snack, or just simply something more on the  healthy side to feed the kids, Pamela's Whenever Bars are a filling and flavorful option.  The overall flavor and texture actually seem more like a homemade cookie than a ""whenever bar.""  The ingredient list also has several interesting additions you won't find in many other snack bars, such as chia seeds and even agave.<br /><br />An unfortunate problem with the average non-dairy snack is dealing with a dry texture or a lack of sweet flavor.  There's no question that Pamela's Whenever Bars are less moist than a gooey bakery cookie or a chocolate bar, but they aren't overly dry and have a pleasant texture.  Picky kids might complain about the difference, but it's not a huge deal and the raisin walnut flavor more than makes up for it.<br /><br />While there are better tasting non-dairy baked goods, there is also a fair share of less appetizing ones to be found out there.  With the health benefits of whole grains and Omega 3, as well as a nice fruit and nut flavor, the whenever bars hit the spot as long as you can enjoy the texture."
1666,B00503DOWS,5,1313020800,"I don't actually eat gluten free or diary free, but I loved these.  They weren't that sweet, actually pretty spicy and chock full of nuts and fruit.  They had a great texture as well.  Slightly chewy, but mostly soft.  I had one in the morning and it did a pretty good job of keeping me full for a while.  Nice wholesome ingredients as well.  I can't say I'd buy them considering I don't need the gluten-free and they are pricey, but they were very good."
1667,B00503DOWS,2,1312934400,"I liked the texture and appearance of the bar - you can totally see: oh , this is an oat, here is my raisin, this is a walnut. I like when you can tell what is in the bar by just looking on it. It makes it look more of a homemade. The shape is also more just like a cookie dough kind of thing. I looks like somebody took a piece out of a huge dough ball, shaped it into a hot dog bun between their hands and flattened it by slapping it on a counter. It tastes fine - nice to see a new nut used in granola bars. They are also very moist. However main disappointment is the size. It is more like a kid size snack with adult calories in it - 180cal, 9 g of sugar and fat. It is ok on sodium - 140mg. I also wish it did not hav eggs or xanthan gum. This product is not vegan. And I think all the syrup and raising could have made it chewy enough - no need to weird ingredients. I would not have paid 75cents for the bar. It is somewhat small for the calories and I am against too many ingredients in it, even though they market it as a health food with their chia seed and such."
1668,B00503DOWS,4,1312934400,"I'm always searching for great gluten free products for my wife. Pamela's bakery always has a great selection, so I jumped on these bars right away.<br /><br />These bars are chewy (akin to Clif bars), nutty, and really tasty. They're quite satisfying, and have 190 calories. They are a bit on the dry side, so you will need to have a glass of water nearby.<br /><br />The first few ingredients are:<br />gluten-free oats, organic agave, rice blend, coconut sugar, and raisins. For those with other food allergies, these bars contain eggs, coconut, and walnuts. They are processed on equipment that also makes products with peanuts, soy, and milk."
1669,B00503DOWS,5,1312934400,"Sometimes, you need a cookie. Not a protein bar, or seaweed with pumpkin seeds, but a grandma type cookie. Thats just a fact of life for most folks. And, if you cant eat dairy, Wheat, or the gluten from various grains due to allergies, then you will be deprived your cookie. Unless you want to buy a ton of items from the health food store, and make your comfort food. That is, if you have time. But, if you dont have time, splurge on some PAMELA'S OAT RAISIN WALNUT SPICE ""bars"". (hey, they're oblong cookies.) ITs a soft, mildly sweet, chewy cookie with great texture and rich taste. These anytime snacks are filled up with every good, expensive ingredient you can imagine, and some you probibly cant. (These are sweetened with coconut sugar. I didnt know there was coconut sugar out there. WOW.) Made from Gluten free Oats, Agave,(sweetener) Rice flour, Coconut sugar, raisins, safflower oil, Eggs, Walnuts, coconut, Chia Seeds, Vanilla flavor and spices, sea salt, and Aluminum Free Baking Powder, with everything Organic that can be, and as healthy as a cookie can be. THESE TASTE FANTASTIC! Each box has 6 cookies, individually wrapped in aluminum. OKAY, they each have 180 calories, so you shouldnt gobble down the box. However, when you have something this tasty and special, its best to ""sip"" the cookie like fine wine. So, if you are looking for some good treats, and you have food alergies, these ""whenever bars"" will satisfy that little fact of life we all understand. Sometimes, you just need a cookie."
1670,B00503DOWS,3,1312761600,"This product is a satisfying snack. Does tastes a bit like oatmeal cookies but sweetened by raisins, agave & coconut sugar, not cane sugar. I think it would taste even better with more walnuts but that would probably increase the calories. Honestly, I didn't find one walnut in my first bar and was shocked to learn that walnuts were even a listed ingredient!<br /><br />I liked it but probably won't repurchase. Each bar is about 1.4 ounces, which seems to me to be a small amount for the cost ... and the calories!"
1671,B00503DOWS,5,1312675200,These were sooooo good. The spice was perfect. My husband and I really enjoyed these and I've been packing them in our lunches. They aren't teeny tiny but they aren't large. It costs more to buy healthier and I think these are worth it.
1672,B00503DOWS,5,1312675200,"This is a snack that has wholesome ingredients and can satisfy that ""sweet tooth"" we all get sometimes.<br />I am not a fan of granola, it is too syrupy sweet and I don't like chewing the hard oats, and feeling like Secretariat (the horse) instead of a secretary at my desk at work! Try answering the phone with a mouthfull of granola bar, it isn't pretty, trust me.<br />The first bite just reminded me of fall flavors, and I thought the BEST complement to this bar would be a fresh glass of fresh pressed apple cider!<br />The spices are spot on.<br />AND, they are soft with a good texture, easy to chew and easy on the dental work, unlike sticky hard TOO CHEWY granola bars.<br />This bar is Wheat free, Gluten free, and dairy free.<br />IT IS NOT a low calorie bar, however at 180 calories and 9 grams of fat (0 trans, 1.5g Saturated) this bar is still TONS better health wise than say, a piece of pumpkin pie or ginger spice cookies. Which are TWO of the treats I could do without if I got a craving for them and had this bar!<br />This is a PRODUCT OF THE USA! I'll briefly list nutrition:<br />Calories 180<br />Fat 9 g (1.5g sat, 0 trans)<br />CHOL  15mg<br />Sodium 140mg<br />Total carbs 24g  (Dietary fiber 2g, Sugars 9g)<br />Protein 2g<br />There aren't any nutrients listed that are more than 4% Daily values--so I am not bothering to list them, they are negligible)<br />Ingredients: Gluten free oats, Organic Agave, Rice Blend (Brown rice flour, white rice flour, tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, Xanthan gum) Coconut sugar, Raisins, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, walnuts, coconut, chia seeds, natural vanilla flafor, spices, baking soda, sea salt, Xanthan Gum, Grainless and aluminum bree baking powder (sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, potato starch)<br />Allergy information: Contains Egg, Coconut, and Walnut, Processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy, and milk.<br /><br />I found these handy bars were great for an on the go healthy snack that kept me away from other unhealthier alternatives. I can highly recommend these as a yummy treat, and I will buy them again!"
1673,B00503DOWS,5,1312675200,"I'll start with the nutritional/health aspect.  This 1.41 Oz snack is filling at 180 calories.  Not much nutritional value (2% DV calcium, 4% DV iron).  High fiber, moderate sodium (140mg).  Not a lot of sugar (9g).  In all . . . probably not good couch food, but is a filling compact snack when on the go and you need a lift, or maybe for the mini-breakfast eater.<br /><br />The texture issue:  somewhat sticky/gooey/pastey, with a wee bit of crumbling when attacked.  None of it excessive.<br /><br />Flavor is quite good.  I particularly enjoyed the large identifiable walnut pieces, rather than the micro-specs you get in some snack bars. I don't care for raisins (they are in there), but they are soft and whole if you like them.  The spice taste was pleasantly muted and there was a remote banana flavor (maybe the agave,coconut sweetening?).  Yummy.<br /><br />The texture issue aside (which I suspect had to do with the high fiber content) -  I'll give this filling, good-tasting, and reasonably healthy snack a full 5 stars."
1674,B00503DOWS,4,1312588800,"I thought Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bars were tasty. They were chewy with a hint of sweetness. The spice flavor tasted like cinnamon and nutmeg to me. I had one with my coffee for breakfast and I wasn't hungry again until lunch time. These would make a great quick breakfast or snack for when you're on the go. They appear to be healthy too - sweetened with agave and only 190 calories per bar. The fat content does seem a little high though at 9 grams per bar. Overall I would recommend trying them.<br /><br />The allergy information on my box was: Contains eggs, coconut and walnuts. Processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy and milk."
1675,B00503DOWS,4,1312588800,"Pamela's oat raisin walnut spice bars are moist and tasty. Although the ingredients are top notch, they gave me heartburn."
1676,B00503DOWS,5,1312588800,"These bars are made with ingredients that provide a healthy bang for the caloric buck.  Potential allergens are listed in bold on the package and easy to spot. I like that they are wheat-free, gluten-free, and non-dairy; also that they are not sweetened with refined sugar. I found them moist and tasty with a nice aroma and no weird aftertaste. They taste a bit like an oatmeal-raisin cookie with raisins that are especially moist and chewy.  I found them better than the oatmeal-raisin Clif bars. I liked the stronger spice flavors and the addition of walnuts.<br /><br />I will probably buy these when I need a pick-me-up.<br /><br />Con:  They do contain egg so may not be suitable for some vegetarians."
1677,B00503DOWS,4,1312502400,"I wish these weren't so high in calories, because they really were good. I gave some to my picky 4 year old and he was asking for more. They're very soft and remind me of an oatmeal raisin cookie. The shapes of the bars were all irregular which made me think they were hand made and the flavor was close to homemade. I'll be searching these out for purchase again!<br /><br />I received a box for sampling purposed from Amazon Vine. No additional compensation has been received and I was not required to write a positive review."
1678,B00503DOWS,4,1312502400,"These bars are really good, especially with a cup of coffee or tea.  I tried both flavors, the Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut (which the kids preferred) and these, the Oat Raisin Walnut Spice, which was my favorite.  The bars are slightly dry, chewy, and studded with chunks of walnuts and moist raisins.  There's more than a hint of cinnamon, which makes these really yummy!"
1679,B00503DOWS,2,1312416000,"I have been purchasing and trying all sort of energy bars, fiber bars and snack bars for some time. I have no special dietary needs, but if I had to maintain a gluten free diet, then this Whenever Bar would be of greater interest to me. But, at 180 calories in a 1.41 ounce snack bar and only 24g or 8% DV of dietary fiber, there are better and less expensive bars on the market from which those on no food restrictions may choose. The mouth feel was moist and chewy as advertised, but the flavor was not memorable.  On the plus side, this bar did not contain high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetener. And, it has only 6% DV of cholesterol and of salt. So, bottom line, those on gluten restricted diets may well wish to try this bar. Energy bars are very handy for travel. Nice to have when you get stuck in an airport or have a late arrival and all the food places are closed. But, whereas these bars cost close to $4.00 each, it is possible to buy other brands of healthy bars at a quarter the price. So, thanks to small size, high cost, non memorable taste and high calorie count, I ended up rating these a two star."
1680,B00503DOWS,5,1312416000,"I love snacks, so thought I would give these a try.  I was a little hesitant after reading the description on these bars, ""Wheat-free, Gluten-free, and Non-dairy"", since most of the times these types of bars don't taste very good.  I was very pleasently surprised after the first bit.  They bar was so moist and the raisins very plump! They def. filled me up for my mid-morning snack.  The spice in them was just right and everything tasted so good together.  I like that it is low in sugar and packed with whole grains which keep you fuller longer. Can't wait to start giving these to my 3 year old."
1681,B00503DOWS,5,1312416000,"At first bite, Pamela's Oat Raisin bars taste a little bland. But that is only because they aren't made with large amounts of sugar (compared to your standard oat-raisin bar). The taste is, in fact, very natural -almost, if not exactly like, home made. The are very moist,and chewy, too. On the downside, there are not many in the box and the bars themselves are rather small. I found myself liking these bars the more I ate and will definitely buy them at the store as long as they are not too expensive."
1682,B00503DOWS,3,1312329600,"People with celiac disease looking for a tasty cookie that smells like spice cake should definitely try a box of these. For the rest of us, though, they are nothing particularly special... with nutrition only slightly better than a Twinkie and without the staying power of a Clif bar, it is probably best to consider Pamela's Whenever Bars a specialized snack."
1683,B00503DOWS,3,1312329600,"The flavor of these bars is ""okay"".  I don't mind them, but I wouldn't be looking forward to eating one.<br /><br />These are of questionable nutrition.  The ratio of sugar to fiber (4.5 to 1) is not terribly good.  They don't provide much protein.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't particularly healthy but not terrible either.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about the size, but compared to other bars they aren't much different in size but they deliver a lot less nutrition.  Try a ""Luna"" bar instead."
1684,B00503DOWS,3,1312329600,"I thought these bars might be a good substitute for the Honey Nut Cherrios bar that I have for breakfast,I was wrong.<br /><br />Although they are both 40g bars the Cherrios bar is more filling.  They are about even on Calories but the Whenever Bar gets 80 of its 180 from fat, whereas the Cherrios bar gets only 35 of its 160 from fat.  The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.<br /><br />The Whenever Bar tastes like a good spice cake and is moist and flavorful.  As an afternoon or evening snack these would be fine choice."
1685,B00503DOWS,4,1312329600,"They have a good taste. My 5 year old daughter even liked them. They are individually wrapped and won't break apart, so they are good to throw into a bag and eat when you are on the go."
1686,B00503DOWS,4,1312329600,"I opened the box, took out one of the bars, and was surprised at how large the packaging was compared to the size of the actual snack.  It didn't look appetizing at all, and appeared to have been shoved in the wrapper haphazardly.<br /><br />I tried a bite, and was pleasantly surprised at the chewy texture and the flavor.  Also, not having dairy, gluten or soy is a big plus.  The big drawback is that they are rather heavy, and I could only eat about 1/2 the bar (no wonder they are so small).  I think that as a meal replacement, the whole bar would be fine, but as a snack, they might be too much.<br /><br />Overall, this was an okay product.  I would buy it again in the future, but not on a regular basis.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it did have a nice flavor, and works for just about any food allergy..."
1687,B00503DOWS,4,1312243200,"None of the wheat, gluten or dairy makes this bar stand apart.<br />I have no problem with the ingredients excluded from this snack bar, but am always curious about ""clean"" snack options. I'll compare these to two other kinds of snack bar I recently purchased: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTGAUM"">Nature's Path Organic Granola Bars, Peanut Choco', 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFY4"">Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars, Fruit & Nut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.<br />NUTRITIONAL COMPARISON<br />The Whenever Bars list a 40 gram serving size with 190 calories, 80 of them from fat, 9g fat, 1.5g saturated fat, 15mg cholesterol, 140mg sodium, 24g total carbs, 2g fiber, 9g sugars, 2g protein.<br />Nature's Path Peanut Choco bars list 35g serving, 150 calories, 50 from fat, 6g fat, 1.5g saturated fat, 0 cholesterol, 125mg sodium, 80mg potassium, 22g carbs, 2g fiber, 11g sugars, 3g protein.<br />The Nature's Valley bar also has a 35g serving size, 140 calories, 35 of them from fat, 4g total fat, .5g saturated fat, 0 cholesterol, 65mg sodium, 25g carbs, 2g fiber, 13g sugars, 3g protein.<br />None of these bars contains trans fats. Adjusted for size, the Whenever Bar is higher than the others in calories, calories from fat, cholesterol. Nature's Valley is the sodium winner (lowest) and carbs (highest). The Nature's Path and Nature's Valley bars deliver 177% of the Whenever Bar's protein content, again on a comparable weight basis.<br />EATING COMPARISON<br />Each of these bars delivers a distinct eating experience. The Whenever Bar is soft, a bit like a soft-baked cookie. It's a little dry and slightly crumbly. Mind you these traits are not overwhelming and did not bother me at all. The flavor is fine.<br />The Peanut Choco bar is gooey and denser than the Whenever Bar, and seems much sweeter.<br />The Fruit & Nut Trail mix bar is very dense, chewy and nutty. You know that you're biting into something when you eat these.<br />Did I like the Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bar? I did. Were I avoiding wheat, gluten or dairy, I'd welcome this option. Not having those issues to deal with, I consider it a viable alternative to the other snack bars I enjoy."
1688,B00503DOWS,3,1312243200,"Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bars are a viable alternative to granola bars - if you're tired of the crunchy, stick-to-your-teeth bars, you can alternate with these soft stick-to-your-teeth cookies.<br /><br />On the nutrition/calorie front, Pamela's bars are wheat, gluten, and dairy free, and they contain no trans fats.  One cookie has 140mg of sodium (6% of the `allowable' daily amount).  At 190 calories each, they're similar if slightly higher in calories than most granola bars.  Their Cholesterol (15 mg), total fat (9 g), and carbs (24g) put them in the snack class for my family.  This is dessert, not good nutrition.<br /><br />I did find the cookies to be more like a homemade soft cookie than a granola bar and that was a pleasant change.  Although, at least for me, they cried out for an accompanying glass of milk.  Perhaps they're a tad dry?<br /><br />I did have a relatively strong gastro reaction to the cookie.  I doubt that you want to know more about that.  Suffice it say, if you're at all grain sensitive, don't try these for the first time when you're away from home.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Three stars.  Another entry into the `healthy' snack category that's adequate but fails to stand out."
1689,B00503DOWS,5,1312156800,"Before eating my first ""Pamela's Gluten-free Whenever Bar; Oat Raisin Walnut Spice,"" I was mentally preparing to provide a list of all the technical details I would be listing in my review.  Then I had a bite.<br /><br />These odd little ""bars"" (its not really a bar, since it lacks a defined rectangular shape) taste just like my Grandmother's ginger cookies.  Everything else I would have said pales in comparison.  Basically, if you taste like grandma used to make, that sort of trumps everything else, and you get five stars.<br /><br />Warning: They taste really good, and knowing that you are eating something carefully designed to be very healthy and organic, its tempting to have more that the two I have budgeted for lunch today.<br /><br />The first one had a huge piece of walnut in the end.  The second one was heavy on raisins.  Each one appears to have its own character, as if they are made in small, individual batches.  List of ingredients on the side:  Gluten-free oats, organic agave, rice blend (mostly brown rice flour), coconut sugar, raisins, mono-saturated safflower oil, organic eggs, walnuts, coconut, chic seeds, natural vanilla, spices, baking soda, sea salt, xanthan gum, grainless and aluminum free baking powder.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm a big gluten fan.  Sometimes I bake bread on weekends and I knead the dough by hands.  I love stretching it out into thin films and I can literally manipulate the gluten to maximize the chewy texture in the resulting loaf.  But 1% or so of the world's population suffers from an abnormal immune reaction to partially digested gliadin. For those folks, this kind of product is a great alternative to traditional carbohydrates.<br /><br />But for folks who don't have a problem with gluten like me, this a very high quality, great tasting convenience food."
1690,B00503DOWS,4,1312070400,"I will start off by saying that our household has no need for gluten-free products, but I'm always willing to try something new. That said, we've tried a few random gluten-free products, and these are actually pretty tasty. They kinda tasted like a spiced oatmeal cookie or a spiced carrot cake, except I am not big ""spice"" fan and the ingredient list just said ""spices"" so I couldn't pinpoint which spice it was that I didn't love. But my husband ate them and liked them AND my toddler ate them and liked them (though I've found he isn't terribly picky when it comes to granola bars) and I would eat it if they were all we had, but that strange spice flavor knocked them out of contention for me. But overall I'd give them a strong four stars."
1691,B00503DOWS,5,1312070400,"Each bar contains a full day's ration of carbohydrates, which makes it a bit hard to get thru the rest of the day without getting too much carbohydrate.  My wife, my son who happened to be with us, and I could easily and happily eat several every day if they weren't such diet-busters.  For those of you who can handle more carbohydrate, we would heartily recommend them."
1692,B00503DOWS,5,1312070400,"Pamela's Whenever Bars (Oat Raisin Walnut Spice) are awesome! I put the box in my car so I could snack on the go. They are hard to stop eating. These bars are like a mini spice cake. I love the moistness and the wonderful textures. It is hard to believe these are healthy for you, but they are (at the recommended serving size). For 140 calories per bar, these really fill me up until my next meal. These is great for those with allergies, but they do contain nuts. Thankfully, I am not allergic to nuts. I will defintiely be buying some more!"
1693,B00503DOWS,4,1312070400,"The first one of these I tried was pretty dry, I did not like it. The second one was moist and chewy, as were the rest. I guess the first one must not have been sealed! These had a good flavor and were pretty satisfying as a breakfast (I tend to eat a light breakfast). They have plenty of nuts in them, and the flavor is great. Several reviews state that the bar is very small, I thought it was plenty big enough, the wrapper fits very loose though so it may lead you to believe that the bar would be larger. I would purchase again."
1694,B00503DOWS,4,1311984000,"I liek these small bars.  They are rich and dense as well as tasty, although perhaps a bit too rich for more than one at a time. Not too large, I was glad to eat it guilt-free as I am on a medical diet; one bar did not violate my daily intake.  The price is high, but they are good."
1695,B00503DOWS,5,1311984000,"One of the best aspects of these bars is that they are soft and easy to chew without easily falling to pieces. The prime consequence of this characteristic is that the flavor comes out immediately when you take a bite. It also makes them easy to consume while on the go. As a lover of walnuts and raisins, these two ingredients make it very tasty for me and the other ingredients make it a very healthy food, suitable for almost all diets.<br /> A company called Pamela's Products makes the bars and the company donates to Celiac Spine and Autism organizations, another valuable point to consider when pondering the purchase of these tasty treats."
1696,B00503DOWS,4,1311984000,"Pros:<br />- Delicious<br />- Moist and chewy as advertised<br />- Gluten- and dairy-free, if you need that<br /><br />Cons:<br />- As with all makers of granola-type bars, why insist on individually packing each bar?  Isn't there a more environmentally friendly way?"
1697,B00503DOWS,5,1311897600,"Yum! If you want a granola bar without loads of sugar and high fructose corn syrup, this is a good choice. These bars are not overly sweet. I found the flavor very satisfying -- plenty of oats and nuts in the taste. There are also little cripsy bits of rice in the mix, making this bar full of textures -- crispy, crunchy, and chewy.  They are a cross between an oatmeal raising cookie and a chewy granola bar. Very, very yummy without the overpowering flavor of preservatives that is in most store bought goods.<br /><br />Aside from the rice, they actually taste like something I would make from scratch. They even look homemade, too.<br /><br />These bars are about three inches long and two inches wide. They are shaped naturally, like a human made them rather than a machine cut them into a strict rectangle. (They probably are made by machine, but I did notice the more homemade appearance when I opened the package. It all gave me a nice, healthy feeling as I ate them.)"
1698,B00503DOWS,5,1311897600,"The Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bars were really good for not being something totally yummy like a Cadbury's Chocolate Bar. The taste is a mix of a sweetened bowl of oatmeal and an oatmeal cookie. It's too soft to be a cookie, but too formed to be a bowl of oat meal, if that makes sense. The ingredients are wholesome with oaks, agave, rice flours, tapioca, safflower oil, xanthan gum, raisins, sun flower seeds, coconut oil, sea salt, baking powder (grain and aluminum free, no less)and potato starch. It's not low in the calorie department with 190 calories a bar and 9 grams of fat. It also has 24 grams of carbs and 2 grams of fiber for those watching their carb counts. And it gives you a 2 grams of protein. For a gluten-free, wheat-Free, non-dairy snack, it's not bad at all. It should be a big hit for the Vegan/wholesome food crowd (of which I'm not).<br /><br />However, this is a tad pricey. At $23 for a 6 pack of 5 bars each, that comes out to $3.83 a box or .76 a bar. This comes out a little too high for my family's food budget."
1699,B00503DOWS,3,1311897600,"Oatmeal cookie anyone? This Whenever Bar is gluten-free, wheat-free etc. etc. It all boils down to ""it's good for you."" The packaging is not so good for you with the individually wrapped bars. Surely a company so dedicated to healthy food can also be a bit more environmentally conscious.<br /><br />But the bar itself was tasty. It's very soft. Almost too soft really. When I read ""bar"", my mind assumes there will be some barness to the thing. This was very soft. I think my expectations would have been different if it was a Whenever Cookie.<br /><br />It smells and tastes like an oatmeal cookie. Loaded with raisins and walnuts, this bar made me feel like I was having a substantial snack. The fact that it is 180 calories in one bar with 9 grams of fat didn't feel all that healthy though.<br /><br />Overall, I have mixed feelings about this bar. I mean, it does taste good. It does deliver on flavor. I'm just not convinced it is the healthiest snack available for my money and calorie count. I doubt I'd buy these unless I had someone coming over who needed gluten-free snacks available."
1700,B00503DOWS,5,1311897600,"There are a lot of granola/snack bars available so I thought this might just be one more, but I was surprised. This reminds me of eating a moist oatmeal cookie only better because it is gluten free, low in cholesterol, lots of omega 3 fatty acids and a good source of fiber. Not only tasty, but healthy too. My wife has a gluten intolerance so these also work for her. These are my new favorite choice for a snack. Excuse me while I go get a glass of milk to go with Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bar. Highly recommended!!"
1701,B00503DOWS,5,1311897600,"Not having been a fan of energy bars and such, I was surprised when I liked the flavor and texture of the Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bar. It is soft and chewy and seems like a human made it in a kitchen. I was pleased to see that organic eggs and agave were used as well as some other organic ingredients. It is not all organic but some of the foods that I feel are most important to be organic are included. And... no nasty chemical ingredients. It does not contain dairy, gluten or wheat which does not matter to me but I know is important to others. I should stress that this is not a crunchy, crumbly type bar. I don't like dry cereal either. It is soft, chewy and has good nut and raisin flavor. I not only recommend this but plan to order some more."
1702,B00503DOWS,3,1311897600,"Nutrition -- If you're already saddled with Celiac disease or have dietary restrictions like me, you're already a label reader. I'm a bit concerned about some of the nutritional information about these bars. Nearly half the calories are from fat. And, the box calorie count was 10 points higher than the label on the individual bar (Pamela's should fix this discrepancy). I'd also be happier if they hadn't used eggs, because that would cut the cholesterol and some of the saturated fat. However, the bar packs a lot of fiber, which will fill you up if you're hiking or being active in general.<br /><br />Texture and shape -- The marketing team must have said that they needed to branch out from cookies. But, the reality is that these are NOT bars, they are cookies. Very similar to good homemade cookies, but cookies nonetheless. They don't have the texture of a granola bar or a protein bar, and aren't easily eaten as a bar because they are soft and flexible. I suppose if you refrigerated them, you could get more of a bar texture since they are a bit on the fatty side.<br /><br />Flavor -- I did not taste very much walnut, but I did encounter raisins and oats. They were sweet, but not overly, which was good. They reminded me of freshly baked oatmeal cookies, but lighter due to the rice flour. I liked the flavor, but wished for more walnuts. I could definitely taste the cinnamon.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say they might want to re-market it as a cookie, since expectations of bars are higher given that most are designed to be meal replacements."
1703,B00503DOWS,4,1311897600,"These snack bars taste like moist oatmeal cookies.  These may be the best tasting snack bar I have ever tried (my husband seconds this).  The bars have a moist texture and they are low on crumbs which makes them a good choice for an afternoon snack at work.  There are a lot of healthy things hidden in these bars which is always a plus.  These contain chia seeds and walnuts, both which are very high in Omega-3 fatty acids (the currently very trendy heart healthy fatty acid).  These are also sweetened with coconut sugar which is considered a low glycemic index food.  Coconut sugar also contains a high amount of minerals and vitamins so this is one of the healthiest sugars for sweetening foods.  This is also sweetened with organic agave, which chemically is a very high fructose sweetener.  For me, this is the one down side to this product.  I try to avoid the use of fructose-based sweeteners, even when they cloak themselves as ""trendy"" alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />They are dairy-, gluten-, and wheat-free but they do contain eggs, walnuts, and coconuts.  They are also processed on equipment shared with peanuts, tree nuts, and soy so they are not suitable for many with food allergies."
1704,B00503DOWS,5,1311811200,"People are always handing me their power bars and I am always disappointed usually because of the sweetness or dryness of the bars. These bars are tasty, moist, and the sweetness is not overpowering. What's even nicer is I can share these with my friends with gluten intolerance but frankly I don't think the box is going to last that long.<br /><br />I eat these straight out of the wrapper, keeping it in and pushing it along. No crumbs from these. I would not describe these as ""chewy"" but they are moist."
1705,B00503DOWS,4,1311811200,"These are a delicious chewy-type snack bar.  Very yummy!!  They have no aftertaste or fake, weird taste like so many gluten free foods do.  The 4 rating (instead of 5) is because they are 190 calories/9g fat, despite their small size.  They also are processed on equipment that also makes products contain peanuts, other tree nuts, soy and milk, which can be an issue for people with other food allergies (outside of gluten)."
1706,B00503DOWS,5,1311811200,"I don't have any food allergies, but I have some close friends who can't tolerate gluten, so I'm always on the lookout for gluten-free foods that I can recommend or provide at parties.  I've also been trying to commit to finding healthy snacks to keep at my desk at the office.  These bars are delicious, gluten-free, and a great size for a quick snack.  With organic ingredients, lots of fiber, and only 190 calories per bar, I can also feel like I'm doing something good for my body when I enjoy them.  I like that the box is made of recycled paper, that the cinnamon flavor really pushes through in each bite, and that the list of ingredients is made up of words that I can pronounce.  I only have one problem with the bars: the texture.  I know that without gluten, it is nearly impossible to create baked goods that behave like standard baked goods, and the bars do achieve a nice softness that feels good to chew.  Still, the bars don't hold together well at all.  I found that I needed to unwrap a bar and use the package as a napkin, otherwise, the poor thing would crumble apart.  I don't know that this is a problem that can be solved without gluten, but it does make the product less portable (with a regular oatmeal breakfast bar, you can chew on it while you drive to work or even while you walk to your car, but you really need to be focused to get the most out of this snack).  I certainly wouldn't avoid buying these bars just because of the texture - the taste really is delicious - but it's something that a buyer should know before unwrapping the first taste.<br /><br />These snacks are a real treat, and while they're not safe for every allergy (the name includes ""walnut,"" after all), they're easily good enough to delight someone with a gluten intolerance, and people who can have gluten should even try them for their delicious taste."
1707,B00503DOWS,5,1311811200,"This resembles a soft, chewy, coconutty oatmeal cookie.  I think ""coconut"" should be part of the description because it's sweetened with coconut as well as agave, and some folks don't like the taste of coconut (but I love it).  The bars were a hit with the rest of my family as well. As for the price, I'd say these are more comparable to Clif or Odwalla or other similar bars that typically are $1-2 apiece, than something like Quaker chewy granola bars, so I think they're competitively priced.  I'd get them again!"
1708,B00503DOWS,4,1311811200,"I'm not a health nut, ok? I've just never been big on the taste of most fruits or veggies, and granola ranks as practically a vegetable on my list.  So I was skeptical about trying this.<br /><br />Taste reminded me of oatmeal raisin cookies!  They are somewhat sweet, and moist.<br />Not crumbly or messy at all. Yummy! Great for at work!<br /><br />a few notes:<br />The foil wrapper is about an inch too long for the product.<br />Bar is more oval shaped than rectangular.<br />180 calories per ""bar."" Yikes! That's as much as a plain chocolate candy bar!<br /><br />These could probably be easily marketed as cookies.<br />I give them two thumbs up!"
1709,B00503DOWS,5,1311811200,"More like a cookie than a granola bar, this treat has a soft cookie-like consistency generously embedded with crunchy nuts and sweet raisins. A little spicy, redolent with cinnamon, not too sweet but sweet enough to be the perfect desert for a lunch box. Tastes a little bit like grandma's favorite oatmeal cookie but is a lot healthier. Hard to be a critic when it's so good. Pretty good for breakfast as a side to yoghurt and fruit. Or a great finish to a salad dinner when you want something a little sweet to round off a tart dressing. Nice pick-me-up for a mid-afternoon snack. The box is right...this is a ""whenever"" bar. Highly recommended."
1710,B00503DOWS,4,1311724800,"Special diet stuff? Then it's got to be yucky, right? NOT! These bars are quite tasty and I think my son summed it up best by describing them as gingersnaps crossed with an oatmeal walnut raisin cake. The bars are moist and chewy with walnuts and chia seeds to give it an added interesting texture.<br /><br />Three of us here in the household tried the bars. My husband didn't care for them because of the walnuts and seeds. He says he didn't like all that extra ""work"" to eat his snack bar. He isn't one for nuts in his snack foods, either, so... He gave it between 2-3 stars.<br /><br />My son ate all his and said it was OK, but he wouldn't go out and buy a box to have around to snack on. He gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />Me - well I thought they were really very good. I enjoyed that extra texture supplied by the chia seeds, and I love oatmeal, raisins, nuts and coconut in my snacks. I'm all about flavors and textures, and this one was a hit for me! I'm giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />Each box contains five 40g (1.41oz) bars. Each bar contains 190 calories of which 80 of them are from fat. Out of the 9g of fat (13%), 1.5g is saturated (8%) and contains no Tran Fat. Each also contains 140g of sodium, 9g sugar, and 2g dietary fiber."
1711,B00503DOWS,5,1311724800,"Delicious and I know those who are looking for gluten free snacks will love this one. What I liked about the bar was the fact that it was soft. I'm not fond of those that are so hard you have to break them just to get a bite.<br />I truly enjoyed this bar, it's taste, and I felt like I was eating something good for me."
1712,B00503DOWS,5,1311724800,"YUM! YUM, YUM, YUM!<br /><br />Moist, soft, and spicy--the reviewer who described them as a sort of cake-cookie hybrid was right on.  Great texture.  Lovely molasses-y, spice cookie-like flavor.  I do find these sweet (not too sweet), but I don't have much of a sweet tooth and find most granola/snack bars on the market too sweet.  These are refreshingly different.<br /><br />They're under 200 calories per bar. For comparison purposes, there are around 110 calories and an estimated 3 grams fiber in a banana.  One large apple has around 100 calories and an estimated 4.5 grams fiber.  So these bars have a higher calorie count than fresh fruit, but also a higher fiber content and a 350 milligrams of Omega-3s.<br /><br />Bottom line: like any sweet food (including fruit) these should be consumed in moderation.  ""Whenever"" might need to be limited to one per day over several week days.  However, I certainly intend to continue consuming them as they are really delicious!"
1713,B00503DOWS,5,1311638400,"These Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bars are delicious to me.  They are the size of a thick medium cookie, are slightly chewy, and are very tasty despite the fact that they do not taste sweet at all.<br /><br />The first three ingredients in order are gluten-free oats, organic agave, and a rice blend.  As for the rest of the cookie's name raisins are the fifth ingredient, walnuts the eight, and spice the eleventh.  The cookie contains eggs and coconut as well. The package claims that you get 350 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and 9 grams of fiber per bar.<br /><br />Each bar is high in calories and I don't know which calorie count is correct. According to the box, each cookie is 190 calories but the individual wrappers say 180 calories.  Both say 80 calories are from fat.  Nevertheless, these are certainly a better choice than a candy bar and since these are wheat and gluten free, they are a good snack for individuals with Autism or Celiac Disease.<br /><br />I really love the taste and texture of these bars.  I was going to share one with my boyfriend but now I'm not sure they'll be any left for him."
1714,B00503DOWS,5,1311638400,"These ""Whenever Bars"" are delicious and hearty.  They are Oat, raisin, walnut.  Bite into one and you experience something that is not quite cookie, and not quite cake ... kind of in between.  Chewy consistency, crunchy given the nuts.<br /><br />I love them.  They taste like pumpkin bread with the various spices.  I don't think that I could ask for a nicer snack.  Two of them with a coffee would make a great, hearty breakfast.<br /><br />Delicious. I want to order more but they are out of stock.  I guess the secret is out.  Yummy!"
1715,B000XSGMHO,5,1196640000,These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.<br /><br />I found them to be very sweet.<br />Makes a great snack or even dessert!
1716,B000XSGMHO,5,1196640000,"The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."
1717,B000XSGMHO,5,1194998400,Delicious as breakfast or a snack.<br />I bought these as an alternative to<br />non-organic cereal & milk for breakfast.<br /><br />They were a big hit & I do not have to keep<br />non-organic milk on hand.  I have not been<br />able to find organic powdered milk they will<br />drink.
1718,B000XSGMHO,4,1193875200,"I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.  These make a great snack.  They are very sweet.  I cannot eat just one which is probably bad.  I think I am going to try the unfrosted variety to see if they are less sweet."
1719,B000XSGMHO,4,1182902400,Toast it for 1 min. perfect breakfast. I wish it was a little less sweet though.
1720,B000XSGMHO,2,1181779200,"Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan."
1721,B000XSGMHO,3,1191196800,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
1722,B000XSGMHO,2,1258848000,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
1723,B000XSGMHO,2,1255132800,"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
1724,B000XSGMHO,1,1328659200,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber...Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!<br /><br />Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Invert, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Palm Oil, Organic Whole Wheat Flour"
1725,B000XSGMHO,3,1237680000,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
1726,B000XSGMHO,5,1176508800,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."
1727,B000XSGMHO,5,1149638400,The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1728,B000XSGMHO,5,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry"
1729,B000XSGMHO,5,1168473600,"These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
1730,B000XSGMHO,5,1198972800,"First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
1731,B000XSGMHO,5,1189641600,"I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite."
1732,B000XSGMHO,5,1164326400,These toaster pastries are very very good.These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts.You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack..
1733,B000XSGMHO,5,1201910400,"I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND."
1734,B000XSGMHO,5,1199923200,"These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them ""Purple Flurp"" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too)."
1735,B000XSGMHO,5,1197244800,"I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry."
1736,B000XSGMHO,4,1200614400,"Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much..."

1738,B000XSGMHO,5,1160179200,"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase."
1739,B000XSGMHO,5,1169942400,"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor."
1740,B000XSGMHO,4,1187136000,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
1741,B000XSGMHO,5,1196640000,"I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes."
1742,B000XSGMHO,4,1193961600,These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!

1745,B000XSGMHO,5,1155513600,"Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!"
1746,B000XSGMHO,5,1238371200,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door.
1747,B000XSGMHO,4,1209340800,"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box."

1749,B000XSGMHO,5,1230422400,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure."
1750,B000XSGMHO,5,1226534400,i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
1751,B000XSGMHO,5,1204848000,"Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!"
1752,B000XSGMHO,5,1202428800,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
1753,B000XSGMHO,5,1200873600,"One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients."
1754,B000XSGMHO,4,1189987200,"These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
1755,B000XSGMHO,3,1181779200,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
1756,B000XSGMHO,5,1329350400,"Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!"
1757,B000XSGMHO,5,1283299200,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
1758,B000XSGMHO,5,1272499200,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
1759,B000XSGMHO,5,1243209600,"My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard ""pop-tarts"", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement.

1760,B000XSGMHO,5,1237248000,these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry

1762,B000XSGMHO,4,1221350400,"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!"
1763,B000XSGMHO,5,1219190400,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
1764,B000XSGMHO,5,1215820800,"I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!"
1765,B000XSGMHO,5,1206921600,"My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."

My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."

1773,B000XSGMHO,5,1187827200,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run.  They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
1774,B000XSGMHO,5,1181260800,Recommended.  Good price when bought in bulk.
1775,B000XSGMHO,5,1177804800,These are delicious! They are much better and much better for you and the planet than more processed alternatives.
1776,B000XSGMHO,5,1214438400,"These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
1777,B000XSGMHO,5,1350518400,"Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.  Getting them from Amazon is even better, because they are much cheaper.  Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon."
1778,B000XSGMHO,4,1347926400,"We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."
1779,B000XSGMHO,5,1344556800,"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support."
1780,B000XSGMHO,5,1343347200,"I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of ""food,"" is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more."
1781,B000XSGMHO,5,1342310400,"First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a ""healthy"" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation."
1782,B000XSGMHO,5,1340755200,"What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth."
1783,B000XSGMHO,5,1337472000,This is a great price for a healthy food for my kids!  Like the convenience of purchasing and scheduling deliveries when needed.
1784,B000XSGMHO,5,1318982400,"My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat."
1785,B000XSGMHO,5,1316736000,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
1786,B000XSGMHO,5,1302134400,I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.  Amazon has a lower price than my local grocers.
1787,B000XSGMHO,4,1299110400,"I like these, paltry on the frosting! Can see right through it, not just in one spot, all of it."
1788,B000XSGMHO,5,1298246400,"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
1789,B000XSGMHO,4,1297814400,"The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly."
1790,B000XSGMHO,5,1294358400,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
1791,B000XSGMHO,5,1291939200,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
1792,B000XSGMHO,5,1288915200,"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"
1793,B000XSGMHO,5,1284681600,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
1794,B000XSGMHO,5,1282521600,These are the best toaster pasties we have had. Nature's Path has the best flavors and ingredients and at a good price - a good deal and good for you all around. I purchase them over and over. My husband loves them. Everyone that tries them loves them. And the best part is they are organic too!
1795,B000XSGMHO,5,1277596800,"Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets."
1796,B000XSGMHO,4,1276732800,organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.
1797,B000XSGMHO,3,1275782400,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
1798,B000XSGMHO,5,1274054400,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
1799,B000XSGMHO,5,1269993600,"I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or ""pomegran"" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!"
1800,B000XSGMHO,5,1268438400,"If you like pop tarts these taste great and are ""healthy"" (well as healthy as a sweet, frosted pop tart can get anyway). If you are going to buy pop tarts for your kids, spend the extra money and buy these,"
1801,B000XSGMHO,5,1267056000,"I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good. Good flavor, nice quick and easy snack."
1802,B000XSGMHO,5,1265414400,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
1803,B000XSGMHO,5,1261872000,A good breakfast or snack option for kids on the go- and without all the icky additives.  We all like them!  Buy them with the Subscribe and Save and they are a great deal!
1804,B000XSGMHO,5,1260835200,These are great.  Loved em.  My only complaint I guess would be the price here.  I bought a 32 count box of these at Costco for only 7.99.  You could buy the same quantity for about half the cost there vs here.
1805,B000XSGMHO,5,1253577600,"I prefer natural foods with minimal processing, and we are kosher. This is an amazing product. Excellent for any time of the day, good for snacks, or along with breakfast. My kids love them, and I kind of like them too."
1806,B000XSGMHO,5,1245888000,"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community."
1807,B000XSGMHO,4,1244505600,I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.
1808,B000XSGMHO,5,1240012800,"These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up."
1809,B000XSGMHO,4,1228521600,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
1810,B000XSGMHO,5,1223251200,Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type. Convenient when they need a quick breakfast or after school snack. We buy the strawberry and blueberry often.
1811,B000XSGMHO,3,1219622400,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories.  A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
1812,B000XSGMHO,5,1210377600,My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :)
1813,B000XSGMHO,4,1208649600,"With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children."
1814,B000XSGMHO,5,1208131200,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
1815,B000XSGMHO,3,1202169600,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
1816,B000P52FLW,5,1196640000,These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.<br /><br />I found them to be very sweet.<br />Makes a great snack or even dessert!
1817,B000P52FLW,5,1196640000,"The plain Apple Cinnamon was the first ones that I tried.  After reading some of the reviews, I went out and bought the frosted Apple along with the Frosted Strawberry.  Once again I agree with previous posters stating that the frosted is better than the plain. For me it is almost a tie between the Apple Cinnamon and the Strawberry.  The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."
1818,B000P52FLW,5,1194998400,Delicious as breakfast or a snack.<br />I bought these as an alternative to<br />non-organic cereal & milk for breakfast.<br /><br />They were a big hit & I do not have to keep<br />non-organic milk on hand.  I have not been<br />able to find organic powdered milk they will<br />drink.
1819,B000P52FLW,4,1193875200,"I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.  These make a great snack.  They are very sweet.  I cannot eat just one which is probably bad.  I think I am going to try the unfrosted variety to see if they are less sweet."
1820,B000P52FLW,4,1182902400,Toast it for 1 min. perfect breakfast. I wish it was a little less sweet though.
1821,B000P52FLW,2,1181779200,"Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan."
1822,B000P52FLW,3,1191196800,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
1823,B000P52FLW,2,1258848000,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
1824,B000P52FLW,2,1255132800,"I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster ""pastry"" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing."
1825,B000P52FLW,1,1328659200,"Companies should be ashamed of themselves. These are far from Whole Grain...The 1st ingredient is Organic Wheat Flour...not whole grain! That is the 5th item listed and only provides 1 gram of fiber...Many companies are on the band wagon portraying their products as whole grain goodness and this is because the FDA has not come up with guide lines for whole grains...!<br /><br />Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Invert, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Palm Oil, Organic Whole Wheat Flour"
1826,B000P52FLW,3,1237680000,I was annoyed that I could not return these(did not know that when I bought them)they are very sweet & have 5 grams of fat each which is not very healthy in my opinion.
1827,B000P52FLW,5,1176508800,"I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely ""healthy"" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome."
1828,B000P52FLW,5,1149638400,The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1829,B000P52FLW,5,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry"
1830,B000P52FLW,5,1168473600,"These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
1831,B000P52FLW,5,1198972800,"First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."
1832,B000P52FLW,5,1189641600,"I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite."
1833,B000P52FLW,5,1164326400,These toaster pastries are very very good.These are filled with real strawberries and not that sugary sweet junk found in poptarts.You can feel good about letting your family have these for breakfast or a snack..
1834,B000P52FLW,5,1201910400,"I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful. To me the traditional Pop Tart taste like cardboard, these you can actually taste flavor. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND."
1835,B000P52FLW,5,1199923200,"These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them ""Purple Flurp"" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too)."
1836,B000P52FLW,5,1197244800,"I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry."
1837,B000P52FLW,4,1200614400,"Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much..."
1838,B000P52FLW,4,1168646400,"All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry<br /><br />(hence 4 stars for this flavor, rather than 5)"
1839,B000P52FLW,5,1160179200,"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase."
1840,B000P52FLW,5,1169942400,"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor."
1841,B000P52FLW,4,1187136000,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
1842,B000P52FLW,5,1196640000,"I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes."
1843,B000P52FLW,4,1193961600,These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!
1844,B000P52FLW,5,1190937600,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries,Frosted Strawberry are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these.<br />Heated up with a glass of milk....HEAVEN."
1845,B000P52FLW,5,1160956800,"I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them."
1846,B000P52FLW,5,1155513600,"Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!"
1847,B000P52FLW,5,1238371200,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door.
1848,B000P52FLW,4,1209340800,"Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box."
1849,B000P52FLW,5,1169769600,"The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste ""slightly"" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.<br /><br />Each pastry is 190 Calories<br /><br />40 Calories from Fat<br /><br />They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1850,B000P52FLW,5,1230422400,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure."
1851,B000P52FLW,5,1226534400,i have four kids and we all love these. i never bought pop tarts for them until i saw these. i bought them initially at earthfare but it is much cheaper to get them here. we have also tried the brown sugar cinnamon but these are the best. :)
1852,B000P52FLW,5,1204848000,"Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!"
1853,B000P52FLW,5,1202428800,I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.  My friends even asked me to order more boxes and they are junk food nuts but didn't care that these are a healthy alternative.  They love them too!
1854,B000P52FLW,5,1200873600,"One of the best, if not the best, Toaster Pastries on the market.  This flavor, Frosted Cherry Pomegranate, is excellent.  I haven't tasted better.  It is good cold or hot and as a snack, it is good  anytime.  Great for the kids.  The price is right. Its organic so no nasty surprises in the ingredients."
1855,B000P52FLW,4,1189987200,"These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!"
1856,B000P52FLW,3,1181779200,"If you're going to go for the Apple, I'd recommend the frosted.  Sure it's more sugar, but it's also a lot more flavor."
1857,B000P52FLW,5,1329350400,"Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!"
1858,B000P52FLW,5,1283299200,"We love Pop Tarts (the name brand ones) but wanted to get away from all the chemicals, food dyes, and especially HFCS that those are loaded with. These are a great substitute!"
1859,B000P52FLW,5,1272499200,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
1860,B000P52FLW,5,1243209600,"My inlaws gave my kids the dreaded cardboard ""pop-tarts"", and well it has been difficult to find a natural, kosher replacement. Well folks here it is, my kids eat them all the time, they make a perfect snack that is not junk. I wish more variety packages were available. I absolutely reccomend this product in all flavors."
1861,B000P52FLW,5,1237248000,these are the BEST! toast light to medium & even the crust is fantastic. Real good with coffee. I'm sad when these are not in my pantry
1862,B000P52FLW,5,1236124800,My wife & mom really like these.  They are really good & replace the breakfast rush meal
1863,B000P52FLW,4,1221350400,"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!"
1864,B000P52FLW,5,1219190400,"After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry. So cheap!"
1865,B000P52FLW,5,1215820800,"I hate Pop-Tarts, but I LOVE Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pastries! The reasons are obvious, Pop-Tarts taste like Brand-X aftificial jelly slathered on cardboard. The taste is bad and the texture is even worse.<br /><br />But, one bite of Nature's Path Organic Frosted Cherry Pomegranite Toaster Pasteries and you are in Heaven. The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky. Add a mug of coffee and you have the perfect on the go breakfast to hold you for quite some time.<br /><br />These things are YUM!"
1866,B000P52FLW,5,1206921600,"My daughter is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her sometimes.  When all the other kids are eating their Poptarts now she can have hers too!  These are really good.  The filling is flavorful and the outside not too dry.  They are pretty too, so she doesn't feel left out when the others are eating their dye-laden bad for them food. I find it hard to keep myself out of the box...."
1867,B000P52FLW,5,1190937600,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Apple Cinnamon are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these."

1869,B000P52FLW,5,1182297600,"Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second. Also tasty right out of the package for an on-the-go snack."
1870,B000P52FLW,4,1174867200,"a little dry, but given that they're pretty healthy (all things considered), i'm willing to forgive..."
1871,B000P52FLW,5,1172102400,"These are very tasty indeed.  The flavors taste natural and fresh, better than I expected, and the texture is very good.  My young son has a real sweet tooth and these are a great treat for him. In fact my whole family enjoys them.  My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of ""Pop Tarts"", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more ""fun"" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies."

1873,B000P52FLW,4,1168646400,It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
1874,B000P52FLW,5,1187827200,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run.  They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
1875,B000P52FLW,5,1181260800,Recommended.  Good price when bought in bulk.
1876,B000P52FLW,5,1177804800,These are delicious! They are much better and much better for you and the planet than more processed alternatives.
1877,B000P52FLW,5,1214438400,"These are great!  Excellent alternative to p**t****.  All time favorite flavor is the Brown Sugar Maple, but the pink frosting on the Wildberry ones make them a closer second runner-up.  Husband also really loves the chocolate ones ... they make a great sweet treat."
1878,B000P52FLW,5,1350518400,"Have really like the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries since I first found them in the grocery store.  Getting them from Amazon is even better, because they are much cheaper.  Amazon could do a better job packing them I think.<br /><br />Nature's Path could also offer a variety pack too for sell on Amazon."
1879,B000P52FLW,4,1347926400,"We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."
1880,B000P52FLW,5,1344556800,"For anyone that has never ate these, you're mind will be blown! Especially if you been eating such brands as Pop Tarts which use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs worst of all! These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support."
1881,B000P52FLW,5,1343347200,"I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of ""food,"" is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more."
1882,B000P52FLW,5,1342310400,"First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a ""healthy"" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation."
1883,B000P52FLW,5,1340755200,"What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth."
1884,B000P52FLW,5,1337472000,This is a great price for a healthy food for my kids!  Like the convenience of purchasing and scheduling deliveries when needed.
1885,B000P52FLW,5,1318982400,"My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat."
1886,B000P52FLW,5,1316736000,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
1887,B000P52FLW,5,1302134400,I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.  Amazon has a lower price than my local grocers.
1888,B000P52FLW,4,1299110400,"I like these, paltry on the frosting! Can see right through it, not just in one spot, all of it."
1889,B000P52FLW,5,1298246400,"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
1890,B000P52FLW,4,1297814400,"The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly."
1891,B000P52FLW,5,1294358400,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
1892,B000P52FLW,5,1291939200,I am still kind of new to buying organic and have bought a few things that have been less than tasty to say the least. Not these. They are absolutely delicious!! They seem to be a little heavier than regular toaster pastries therefore more filling too. To sum them up in one word??? YUMMY!!
1893,B000P52FLW,5,1288915200,"I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the ""original""?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with ""natural"" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)"
1894,B000P52FLW,5,1284681600,"Love these, organic- with tons or real fruit.  Also the pastry portion is much denser and richer than pop-tarts.<br /><br />Downside pricey at supermarkets.<br /><br />Solution- buy them at Amazon by the case.  Don't worry, they will go quicker than you think."
1895,B000P52FLW,5,1282521600,These are the best toaster pasties we have had. Nature's Path has the best flavors and ingredients and at a good price - a good deal and good for you all around. I purchase them over and over. My husband loves them. Everyone that tries them loves them. And the best part is they are organic too!
1896,B000P52FLW,5,1277596800,"Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets."
1897,B000P52FLW,4,1276732800,organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.
1898,B000P52FLW,3,1275782400,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
1899,B000P52FLW,5,1274054400,I love this product...hard to find this flavor in the store and with amazon's great prices and fast delivery...i will keep on ordering...thank you amazon!!
1900,B000P52FLW,5,1269993600,"I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or ""pomegran"" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!"
1901,B000P52FLW,5,1268438400,"If you like pop tarts these taste great and are ""healthy"" (well as healthy as a sweet, frosted pop tart can get anyway). If you are going to buy pop tarts for your kids, spend the extra money and buy these,"
1902,B000P52FLW,5,1267056000,"I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good. Good flavor, nice quick and easy snack."
1903,B000P52FLW,5,1265414400,"My daughter loves these ""Pop-Tarts"".  She often eats them in the morning with a yogurt before school.  I will eat them too when I am craving something sweet that won't give me a sugar rush.  These are a great choice for all parents looking for a healthier version of the ""Pop-Tart"""
1904,B000P52FLW,5,1261872000,A good breakfast or snack option for kids on the go- and without all the icky additives.  We all like them!  Buy them with the Subscribe and Save and they are a great deal!
1905,B000P52FLW,5,1260835200,These are great.  Loved em.  My only complaint I guess would be the price here.  I bought a 32 count box of these at Costco for only 7.99.  You could buy the same quantity for about half the cost there vs here.
1906,B000P52FLW,5,1253577600,"I prefer natural foods with minimal processing, and we are kosher. This is an amazing product. Excellent for any time of the day, good for snacks, or along with breakfast. My kids love them, and I kind of like them too."
1907,B000P52FLW,5,1245888000,"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community."
1908,B000P52FLW,4,1244505600,I bought these to replace the occational candy bar and for a grab and go snack.  They are delicious and very filling.  Yes they are made with healthy ingredients and yes they are organic.  No this is not diet food.  These babies pack a caloric punch similar to a candy bar and so you need to keep that in mind.  They are great for being a little naughty without filling up on fake food and chemical frappe.
1909,B000P52FLW,5,1240012800,"These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.  I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up."
1910,B000P52FLW,4,1228521600,"Having to ditch pop tarts for their extensive list of ingredients, including trans fat, I first bought the strawberry ones of this brand. I loved them, and bought and entire case here. Then I decided to try blueberry. Both are great, but I liked strawberry better. The only bad thing is that they have a lot of sugar (20g each)."
1911,B000P52FLW,5,1223251200,Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type. Convenient when they need a quick breakfast or after school snack. We buy the strawberry and blueberry often.
1912,B000P52FLW,3,1219622400,"While these are a better alternative than the name brand, they are still quite high in sugar and calories.  A pack of 2 is 400 cals."
1913,B000P52FLW,5,1210377600,My picky daughter absolutely loves these. I thought the conversion from sugary Pastries would be hard for her. But she picks them up herself now. (She's 4) :)
1914,B000P52FLW,4,1208649600,"With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children."
1915,B000P52FLW,5,1208131200,"My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts."
1916,B000P52FLW,3,1202169600,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
1917,B002TMV3CG,3,1277251200,"I am not a coffee snob. I am, however, a former barista who appreciates coffee that has been properly roasted ground and brewed. When I have company I often am complimented on what a good cup of coffee I've served and delight in explaining to my guests that my secret is fresh, coarse ground beans and a french press. That said I do like Starbucks' Breakfast Blend quite a bit though I prefer medium roasts and have recently discovered an excellent fair trade store brand Columbian that is divine.<br /><br />Unless I am in the mood for a coffee treat (think Caramel Frappucinos) or a home brewed cappucino I only drink my coffee black. I've loved the smell and taste of coffee since I was far too young to be drinking it so when I drink it I want to taste coffee, not sugar and dairy. A badly made cup of coffee is downright depressing. I won't drink percolated coffee unless there is nothing else available because it tends to destroy the oils in coffee beans that give them a smooth flavor. Same with overly roasted beans. But I'm getting off subject here...<br /><br />What did I think of Melitta Cafe Collection's Blanc et Noir?<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was that I wasn't instantly hit with its scent. Half of what I love about making coffee is what I like to think of as the foreplay... that enticing odor teasing me when I open up the bag! Okay, I guess I can live without it. As this is a very finely ground blend I chose to prepare it as espresso. I would not recommend this coffee to those who use a french press (course ground is best when using that method) as you will end up drinking a LOT of the powdery grind that passes through the mesh of your press which for some can cause digestive upsets and for others is just gross. I did not try percolating it but I'm certain others who will review this product will use that method so check out what they thought if you'd like to know.<br /><br />I tried Blanc et Noir both as my preferred cuppa, black, and with steamed milk, as a latte. I was expecting a much stronger flavor for such a beautiful dark brew. As a stand-alone cup of black coffee it wasn't overly memorable. Smooth without the bitterness darker roasts often have or the acidic bite of lighter roasts. It sounds good in theory but by combining the two they somehow loose what makes each special. Which is why I tried it with some steamed milk and a little foam as well. I must say that if you like milk in your coffee this is a lovely coffee to pair with it. Unlike traditional espresso which is a dark roast, the added light roast just gave it something I can't seem to find the right word for.<br /><br />While I don't think Blanc et Noir is one I'd choose for brewing at home given other options I would definitely request it if it were being offered at a coffee house I was patronizing."
1918,B002TMV3CG,4,1277251200,"Although I typically make my coffee very strong, I found that when making a pot of Blanc et Noir I needed to add a good bit less coffee than usual, or the result is **very strong** and slightly bitter coffee.  Not a new favorite but pleasant, fresh, good quality, and as expected.<br /><br />Well packaged with the typical ""fat wire"" turn-down/close mechanism.  Recommended."
1919,B002TMV3CG,4,1277164800,"Before we begin, I am somewhat of a coffee snob -- I roast my own beans weekly.  That being said...<br /><br />I suppose every company would like its products described as ""the best""... This coffee will have to settle for ""damned respectable"".  This stuff is better than most of what can be found at your average grocery store.  It also beats the 'bux though this is a low bar.<br /><br />As for the taste, it is dark and has some of that earthy high end but is not overly bitter.  I would not call the taste ""complex"", but would say it is flavorful.<br /><br />I think given how reasonably priced this stuff is you have a very solid cup of coffee at a very reasonable price.  Point being... You're probably paying more for a worse cup of coffee right now?"
1920,B002TMV3CG,3,1277164800,"I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do drink a lot of it and I have a definite idea of the type of coffee I like and what tastes good. So, based on my limited palate, I can say that there are some things I like about this coffee and some things I don't. This is a medium sort of brew that is neither too strong or too mild and this makes it easy to drink. It's also easy to drink because there is no bitterness or harshness. The downside of this coffee is that there isn't much flavor. It's a sort of bland coffee without much substance ""in the middle."" I can see this coffee being used in an office or during the day when the caffeine effect is more important than the flavor. The only downside to this is that it's a bit pricey for an everyday drink at an office."
1921,B002TMV3CG,4,1277078400,"This is a dark, fullbodied, rich, satisfying coffee.  It isn't bitter either, which is nice since alot of plain coffees I have tried tend to be bitter.  My preference is flavored coffee, but I did enjoy this coffee.<br /><br />I have used Melitta coffee filters before.  Now I will be on the lookout for their coffees.  The price is also reasonable.<br /><br />I think this is a good, everyday coffee, suitable for family and friends."
1922,B002TMV3CG,4,1278201600,"My usual coffee is a dark French roast from New England Coffee Co; I buy it ground, make it a bit strong and use it up before it loses its freshness. Like anyone else who appreciates coffee, I don't want any bitter or burned taste in my brew.<br /><br />This Blanc et Noir ground coffee from Melitta is a blend of light and dark roasts, so I thought it might taste bland. I was pleasantly surprised that it has such a good flavor, though I did need to make it stronger than the package directions recommend to enjoy it fully. Thankfully, making it stronger didn't introduce any bitterness to the flavor. This is a pleasant coffee. I brewed it in a basket-style electric drip pot, which is all I have available at the moment. I don't usually mind if my coffee cools a bit in the cup--don't need it piping hot to enjoy it--but I found this Melitta coffee to be far more flavorful at a just-poured temperature.<br /><br />I probably won't give up my usual coffee for this product, but I'd certainly buy it above other brands when I can't get my preferred New England coffee; that's an eventuality I have to prepare for, since I don't live in New England any more!<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010"
1923,B002TMV3CG,3,1278115200,"I am a Folders Classic Roast kind of girl, I can't tell you the exact notes that I am picking up when I drink Melitta's Blanc Noir coffee - all I can tell you is that it's pretty good, not great, just pretty good.  I have been fiddling with the exact measurements, thinking that you have to use slightly more then you usually would when making a pot, but be careful not to use too much since it tends to taste ""burned"" or over roasted when you use too much.<br /><br />Also, for some reason, flavored coffee creamer seems to be intensified with this coffee blend so do not use too much.  I know, it sounds weird, but that has been my experience.<br /><br />With the name that Melitta has given this product, I was thinking that it would have had a more dominate flavor.  It just was not that way for me.  Back to my Folgers."
1924,B002TMV3CG,3,1277337600,"So many brews, so little time.  First, like with many of the cheaper brands, the bag doesn't open easily- tends to rip. It, of course, has little flaps to close it up.<br /><br />Once opened, it produces a deep and rich smell- for those who simply enjoy, can I say, the bouquet of coffee.  Tastewise-what can I say?  People prefer different brands for different reasons.  For the most part, one knows immediately if this cup suits them. This one is nothing stellar at least not in our house.  At least it wasn't bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />Definitely will drink if nothing else left in cupboard.  Not bad, but simply, not our cup of coffee."
1925,B002TMV3CG,3,1277251200,"I am not a coffee drinker, but my wife is so I got this for her. She likes her starbucks and she'll drink the McDonalds version coffee.<br /><br />Her overall impression of this was it was ok. She wasn't overly impressed with it. I will say that from my non-coffee drinking point of view, when I received this the fresh scent of coffee was very overpowering compared to most bags of coffee I have ever touched. It smelled very fresh.<br /><br />The overall impression however of the taste, it was decent. Not a high end, and not something that will make you want to pour it down the drain. It's just a basic coffee that you could drink every morning."
1926,B002TMV3CG,5,1277251200,"I used this coffee this  morning.  The kitchen smelled good even when I'd just opened the package and even better.....actually wonderful....while it was brewing.  Great taste. In fact, I think I'll go make another pot right now.  Highly recommended."
1927,B002TMV3CG,5,1278720000,"Not too intense,  very good coffee.<br />We usually grind our own but I couldn't tell the difference with this.<br />Good enough and smooth enough to drink black even if you're used to adulterations.<br />The price is not available so I don't know whether I could afford to use this for every day coffee or not. I would if I could."
1928,B002TMV3CG,5,1277769600,"Now it's possible to have coffee shop flavor at home. Melitta Blanc et Noir is full of enticing aroma and smooth, rich flavor. We've been grinding beans at home up till now, but this ground coffee product is the first we've tried that is satisfying in every way, and doesn't turn bitter with time after the package is opened. Highly recommended."
1929,B002TMV3CG,4,1278547200,"This is a very strong, robust coffee that can be overwhelming if your taste buds prefer a more mild flavor. However, my husband adored the flavor. He loves a 'hardy' coffee and often makes it so strong I think my eyes will pop! Whether or not my enamel remains on my teeth depends on who reaches the coffee maker first in the morning. So, if you are like my hubby and love an extra robust flavor and want to fill your house with that grand, eye-popping coffee smell, this particular blend of Melitta Cafe is for you. If your tongue needs to adjust in the early morning and you tend to even out the taste of the beans with milk, I recommend a milder blend."
1930,B002TMV3CG,4,1277769600,"We used this in our Keurig and were delighted.  I think my husband was expecting it to be stronger and bolder, which is why it is getting 4 out of 5 stars.  For me, it was perfect, but he was hoping for something to slap him in the face!  I am a ""lots of cream and sugar"" coffee drinker, and I used about half as much cream as I normally do.  The coffee is amazingly smooth, so I just didn't need as much.  My husband drinks coffee with nothing in it, or just a small sprinkle of sugar and he also enjoyed it by itself.  I think this may be making a regular appearance in our cupboard!"
1931,B002TMV3CG,4,1277510400,"When roasting coffee, there is always a decision on how far to go.  Too little does not develop the nuanced coffee flavor but gives a solid drink, too much yields acrid, bitter blechh so common in certain national chains.  Melitta has addressed this dilemma by including both horns, a well-roasted Noir, and substantial body from the so-called Blanc (medium roast).  What you get is a very drinkable blend without the harsh overtones which have been modulated by the lighter roast.  Of course, being a pre-ground blend, it is important to store properly after opening to maintain this flavor balance."
1932,B002TMV3CG,4,1277424000,"I don't consider myself a coffee ""connoiseur"", but I do know what I like and don't like.<br /><br />Typically, I start my day with a glass of coffee in a frapuccino-style drink, and may have another in the course of a day. I know; many of you are thinking, ""Who cares what THIS guy thinks, the way he drinks coffee?""<br /><br />Well, even though I'm not a ""purist"", the coffee still makes or breaks that drink. Many of the dark roasts give me a very strong, bitter drink that I don't enjoy whatsoever. Other coffees are so bland that I end up with a slightly-colored milk drink of no particular character.<br /><br />I made the coffee as espresso in my Krup machine, then used it as the base for the drink. It came out of the espresso machine with the proper visual, a nice frothy top. Adding the other ingredients -- milk and sweetener -- I found the taste to be rich without bitterness, slightly complex, not at all over-roasted. I then added some Torani vanilla syrup, and thought it was quite delectable.<br /><br />I'd put this coffee on a par with Starbucks.<br /><br />One thing I'd like to point out. The product page discusses this being a ""Pack of 3"". I only received one bag of coffee. Now, I don't know whether this was due to the fact that I received the product through the Vine Program, and quantities were reduced because I got it for free for the purposes of reviewing it, or if there's actually some other issue like a shipping or printing error. I'm simply reporting my experience.<br /><br />Obviously, this has a big effect on the ""value"" of what you're buying for that price."
1933,B002TMV3CG,4,1277251200,"I'm pretty picky about my coffee. It has to be bold. Has to be smooth. Bitter is bad. Burned beans are bad. And hotel conference room coffee from the 100-cup percolator pot is generally the most vile thing on Earth. Little styrofoam cups filled with overheated pool chemicals and mop-bucket waste.<br /><br />In fact, if you've ever taken a sip of the latter and remarked ""hmmm, not a bad cup of coffee!"" then perhaps you shouldn't even consider the purchase of a premium blend, as you would simply be wasting your money. You've destroyed your taste buds and they probably wouldn't be able to appreciate the difference anyway.<br /><br />So I opened the little bag of Melitta with a healthy dose of skepticism. As it was available only ground (given a choice, I grind my own beans), I wondered if it could really be any good.<br /><br />Following the directions on the bag, we put eight teaspoons of coffee in our French press with 24 oz of water, added almost-boiling water, waited about 5 minutes and pushed the plunger. And?????<br /><br />It was quite a bit better than I expected it to be. No hint of bitterness, and low in acidity, it was a very smooth cup of coffee that was lacking in only one area. It wasn't as bold as I would have liked. Having said that, I must say that if a restaurant were to serve this, I'd be thrilled, as I find most restaurant coffee to be less-than-stellar.<br /><br />The Melitta is certainly not going to replace the coffee my wife and I have been purchasing exclusively for the last several years (Raven's Brew, which in my opinion, blows away Starbucks, and even Gevalia), but we'll definitely enjoy the next several pots. Although I may go a little bit 'heavier' on the coffee-to-water ratio next time.<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin"
1934,B002TMV3CG,4,1277164800,"My sack of Melitta coffee is labeled, ""Extra fine grind, Blanc et Noir, Light & Dark Roast.""  The sack, which is airtight until cut, and which contains a firm fastener, contains 312 grams of finely ground coffee.  This product, therefore, will be convenient for adults to brew their coffee early in the morning, without waking up the little ones with the loud grinding sound of grinding coffee beans.<br /><br />I prefer to brew strong coffee, and for this task, I used a brewing machine from Cuisinart.  This machine contains a fine metal filter, not a paper filter. The coffee had a convincing, rich flavor, with a slightly acidic taste.  At any rate, I found this product to provide a brew that was superior to that from Star*****.  I have discovered, with repeated samplings over several years, that Star***** coffee powder has the flavor of ashes from burned wood, or perhaps worse.  I do not think that the Melitta product can match Peet's coffee powder.  Once the Melitta bag is opened, the powder in the bag does not generate much  of an aroma.  In contrast, when a bag of Peet's ground coffee is first opened, it provides a dynamic symphony of aromas.<br /><br />This is about the history of the Melitta company. In 1908, Melitta Bentz, a housewife from Dresden, Germany invented the first coffee filter. On July 8, 1908, Melitta Bentz received a patent for her ""Filter Top Device lined with Filter Paper"" from the Patent Office in Berlin. The 35-year-old housewife was transformed into a businesswoman and, during the same year of her invention, the company bearing her name was established.  Melitta USA, headquartered in Clearwater, Florida is part of the privately held Melitta Group of Minden, Germany. Melitta USA is responsible for the sales and marketing of Melitta coffee filters, coffee, and non electric coffee systems in the USA."
1935,B002TMV3CG,4,1277078400,"Gotta start the day with a cup o' joe, so I put the Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee through its paces. For those who care about such things, I brewed the coffee in an electric drip coffeemaker, using a non-bleached paper filter. I used 18 ounces of water (or three cups according to the coffee package) and approximately 2 teaspoons of coffee per cup as instructed on the package (plus my signature ""one to grow on"" teaspoon that always goes in for a little boost).<br /><br />When I poured the cup, I was pleased to see that the coffee was very dark. I drink my coffee black and I like it strong, so my ratio of water to coffee seemed right for me. I did notice that there wasn't as much aroma as I would have liked. What I did smell had that freshly brewed scent but it was subtle. The flavor was very balanced - not bitter like an overly roasted coffee (Sorry Starbucks) but not wishy washy like most grocery store blends. It was the kind of morning coffee that I enjoy, flavor without being too bold and in my face first thing. Not too much acid, but a bit of a zing. I guess that's why it is a blend of light and dark coffees, which seems to work well.<br /><br />My normal coffee is Gevalia Stockholm and this compared favorably. I thought it was tastier than my runner-up coffee (when I run out of Gevalia), Dunkin' Donuts. I would definitely purchase this blend and I'll recommend it to the coffee fiends in my family."
1936,B002TMV3CG,1,1332460800,"I really enjoy Melita's canned coffee, so I figured this collection would be a real treat. I absolutely hated this blend. This is entirely a matter of taste. I believe the actual quality of the coffee is acceptable, not great, and not bad. The description does not specify the blend to region or location. However this is most assuredly a Arabican blend.<br /><br />As I stated, this is a matter of individual taste. Personally I detest Arabica blends. They leave a strange earthy aftertaste that stays with you for hours. Had I known this was Arabica derived, I would not have purchased it. That information is entirely missing from the product description.<br /><br />From the quality and freshness of this blend (taste aside) I will not be purchasing any further Melitta coffees from this bagged collection. The coffee was nowhere near fresh, the grinds were excessively dry and somewhat stale."
1937,B002TMV3CG,5,1350604800,This was a gift for my husband who drinks coffee every morning. (I do not drink coffee.) He says it is an excellent full bodied coffee that is strong but not bitter.
1938,B002TMV3CG,4,1345334400,"I enjoy coffee and drink 2-4 cups of the stuff a day. Im not a Cafe snob so im not going to pretend i know a lot about the Cafe subject. I bought a Melitta Coffee maker(a rebadged Hamilton Beach) and i figured hey why not try Melitta Coffee. I'm use to buying the Spanish Coffee (Bustello and Pilon). They both are Cuban Espresso blend. That stuff is fine however it is slightly bitter. This Blanc et Noir with light and dark blends is wonderful. There is almost no bitter taste in it all. The one thing with the Melitta coffee some of the ""character"" of the coffee seems to be subdued. Maybe a little to much, robbing the blend of much character or boldness. Seems like in a effort to make a smooth non-bitter coffee some of the characteristics of the coffee was subdued in the process. This isnt to say it has no flavor or character in it. It does, and i can detect the two different levels of the blends. I still enjoy the blend however i dont know where to purchase this locally. I live in a major city so im sure some store must carry it. The price of a individual bag itself isnt bad. A bag of Gevalia here retails for $9-$10, the Melitta is about $7-8 online. However once you factor in the shipping everything equals out. As it stands im not sure if willing to spend twice the amount of what i usually spend on a bag of Coffee. Maybe as a occasional treat i may order it."
1939,B002TMV3CG,5,1323993600,"Like a good bottle of scotch - a very rich and distinct flavor, yet as smooth as the day is long. There's no bitter or burnt aftertaste.  This is my favorite ""everyday"" coffee, and it is reasonably priced. What more could you ask for?"
1940,B002TMV3CG,4,1297900800,"Like most people (I suspect) we tend to stick to the coffee we know and love.  Neither of us are what you might consider ""coffee snobs"" but we both have pretty strong feelings on what is good and bad coffee.  We lean toward stronger brews, but not too acidic.  Hidden flavors are a plus, but not required.  We seem to rotate between Starbucks (Yukon, Pike Place or Pike Place Reserve), Seattle's Best (Henry's Blend), Frederick's, Caffe Vita and El Diablo (on Queen Anne in Seattle!).  So when I was presented with this through the Vine program I was skeptical and was a little concerned and assumed I might be writing a not-so-favorable review, however that turned out to not be the case.  Here are my basic pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bold and Flavorful, but not offensively so!  Other reviewers have called this ""really strong"" or ""too bold"" but I guess it all depends on what you drink.  Personally, we didn't find it so.  Starbucks has a penchant for burning their beans at times giving the coffee and almost acrid, acidic taste - even in the beans you purchase from the store.  This coffee was smooth, rich and good to the last drop.<br />The bag itself was easy to open and reseal.  All too often I end up fighting open a new bag of coffee only to have it all over the counter.  Resealing the bag then requires magician's handy work.  Not so here.  Seems silly to critique the bag itself perhaps, but it's true!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />No adventures here.  Don't expect hints of this or that, or nutty edge.  Not even sure this is a con!<br /><br />All in all, I'd buy this again and I'm glad I gave it a shot!"
1941,B002TMV3CG,1,1294272000,"I do not know whether our product was out-dated, but my wife and I were both very disappointed in this brand of coffee. It had a bitter taste and simply wasn't what we had hoped. In comparison to other dark roast brands, I simply cannot recommend this one. We did not care for the flavor."
1942,B002TMV3CG,4,1293148800,"I am certainly not a coffee expert, though I have been drinking the stuff for 50 years or so.  Nor do I have any of this awesome coffee-making apparatus I see advertized.  I just have my trusty old Melitta drip coffee maker--put the coffee in a filter on the top and pour in your hot water. So, I am certainly no cafe gourmet.  I found this coffee to be quite good in brewing it up.  The coffee is very rich and dark and has a pleasant aroma, especially after you pour hot water on it. It can be too strong if you overdo it, but used in moderate amounts it generates quite a satisfying cup.  Otherwise, it is very easy to utilize even in my primitive equipment. It stores well also--I had my test batch in the fridge for several months and it was just as captivating when I pulled it out as when it first arrived. So, I guess the best term for this coffee is ""moderately hearty"" and quite pleasant."
1943,B002TMV3CG,4,1293062400,"To be honest, I wasn't as taken with this blend as the others, but I think that has to do with my own taste buds. It's a bit too earthy for me. Still it's pretty good overall."
1944,B002TMV3CG,3,1288224000,"This ground coffee was pleasant - not over-roasted, not too weak. However, it's nothing remarkable - we're not talking particularly high-quality beans or a particularly fresh grind. Still, wouldn't make a bad pantry stocker for emergencies (if you're a coffee snob), or a gift for those who aren't really into coffee to begin with. Nothing against Melitta, they're a great brand, I just felt this wasn't quite up to snuff with their reputation."
1945,B002TMV3CG,5,1287878400,"Melitta Cafe COllection Blanc et Noir coffee has a very smooth, refined armoma you notice as soon as you open up the package. That same aroma translates well throughout the brewing process and remains once poured into your cup. Once you taste it, you will find that the flavor is bold yet smooth, it has a slightly dark, powerful flavor without any of the coarseness or bitterness. I went directly from one of those high-pressure coffee pod brewing systems to using the Melitta in a percolator, and it seems Melitta has helped me find my way back to a better cup of coffee."
1946,B002TMV3CG,5,1287619200,"Melitta is definitely a good blend of coffee, but it might be a bit too strong for those who prefer a milder flavor. The aroma is strong, which only serves to accentuate the excellence of it. You can't go wrong with Melitta if you prefer a strong coffee in the morning."
1947,B002TMV3CG,4,1287619200,"We're not huge coffee drinkers so I'm by no means a connoisseur but I AM very picky and don't like a real harsh, bitter coffee.  I was really pleasantly surprised to find that this coffee had a really nice aroma to it and brewed up quite nicely.  Very smooth...no bite at all but quite mellow with a nice flavor.  I'd definitely buy this and think it's worth it for others to try it."
1948,B002TMV3CG,4,1287619200,"I like preground coffee just for the convenience, but I realize grinding your own beans just before brewing is going to be a lot better than the usual ""coffee from a can"".  These are vacuum sealed bags of preground coffee.  It's a great compromise as the coffee is pretty good on the taste front.  The  three bags are small enough that with regular use, you can go through a bag fairly quickly and then open the next vacuum sealed bag without fear of letting your coffee sit around too long exposed to air.  I use sugar and fair amount of cream in mine, so the flavor really has to stand out."
1949,B002TMV3CG,5,1285286400,"I've tried to capture the taste of really fine coffee I've experienced in some excellent restaurants without much success--including grinding my own beans, buying expensive ones at specialty shops, etc.  This product, while not quite doing justice to my memories of great coffee, comes closest.  It is somewhat expensive at about $9/lb.  Supermarket coffees are, of course, much cheaper--and you can get larger packages at discount places for much, much less.  I even tried mixing this coffee with Folgers--and it was pretty good too.  Naturally, this coffee is much richer so one needs to experiment a bit to figure out how much to use in your coffee maker.  I drink coffee straight up--no sweetener, no milk products, but I like it pretty strong--but not burnt or over-roasted.  This coffee is not over-roasted or bitter (unless you use too much of it).  I found it superior to the other Melitta products I've tried as well as to other much-vaunted brands such as Starbucks, Seattle's Best, and Gevalia.  But taste is on the tongue of the beholder..."
1950,B002TMV3CG,4,1284681600,"Pretty good.  Nothing earth shattering though.  Maybe I don't have as keen a taste for coffee as I think I do, but this tastes like a lot of other ""gourmet"" brands to me.  Which is to say it's yummy, just not anything special."
1951,B002TMV3CG,3,1283904000,"Surprisingly mellow coffee with a lingering, embracing aroma that impressed my snobby visitors from England.  I recommend this for your snooty friends."
1952,B002TMV3CG,4,1283817600,"Rich, somewhat strong flavor.  Great aroma.<br /><br />I am a coffee drinker and I totally enjoyed it.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF"
1953,B002TMV3CG,4,1283126400,"As I opened this package of coffee a wonderful aroma burst forth, strong and robust.  The coffee itself is finely ground, and a deep rich color.  I brewed the coffee in my usual drip style coffee maker.  The resulting coffee was rich, and full flavored but only slightly more so than my usual grocery store brand."
1954,B002TMV3CG,5,1283126400,"This coffee is a great way to start the day, though some may prefer a more mild blend. I truly enjoyed this coffee, however, because I love strong coffee, particularly strong coffee that fills the room with strong aroma. If you prefer a more mild coffee, this may not be for you. But if you are like me and want your coffee strong, then I highly recommend Melitta Cafe Noir Ground Coffee."
1955,B002TMV3CG,4,1282780800,"Generally I drink only home pressed espresso - and way too much of it - so for the past few months have been going with drip brewed coffee (except on weekends!) in an effort to cut down on the amount of caffeine I drink.<br /><br />This works, as I can make drip coffee weaker than espresso without it being too watery, whereas weak espresso is simply dreadful. Recall that ""Caff&egrave; Americano"" is espresso with hot water added to it to make it weak enough for our usual national preference, and is not the sort of coffee that I enjoy.<br /><br />Perhaps because it is so finely ground, I find myself using under half as much of this Melitta ""Blanc et Noir"" coffee as I had been using with my previous home ground mix for my drip brewer and still ending up with OK coffee.<br /><br />The ""Blanc et Noir"" also seems to be quite ""smooth,"" though I do find myself adding about a third of a teaspoon of sugar per pint else it is slightly bitter - which seems characteristic of all pre-ground coffees.<br /><br />Though I did get a complementary bag of this coffee from Amazon for review (which is how I found out about it), I liked it well enough that I now have it as a regular order on my Amazon ""Subscribe and Save"" program.<br /><br />It is not great coffee, but it is good coffee. It is what I now take to work everyday for it is much better than that which I can get at the hospital, and, as am using less coffee to make it, it not only has further decreased my caffeine intake, but is cheaper as well.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This item was initially provided by Amazon to me for review."
1956,B002TMV3CG,5,1282262400,When I first received the coffee I wondered how a mix of light and dark would be anything different than just a regular medium brew coffee.  After tasting it I was hooked.  It has the rich dark taste with any bitterness and a smooth finish.  Very comfortable to drink yet bold.
1957,B002TMV3CG,5,1282176000,"We spent some time living overseas and grew accustomed to the fine coffees and espresso so readily available. After moving back to the States, we've searched for comparable coffee, but nothing quite measures up.<br /><br />I've tried some of the other Melitta blends, and they've been...ok...but not spectacular. This Blanc et Noir blend, however, blew me away! It's strong without being the least bit bitter or acidic, rich with a full body. I don't know if/how the flavor may change while sitting on the shelf or in the fridge, because we drank this up so quickly. This is robust coffee for being a blend, and sipping it for breakfast gave me a little taste of Europe."
1958,B002TMV3CG,5,1282176000,"I'm not a coffee drinker, but my husband drinks a ton of coffee ... Starbucks, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts ... you name it, he's probably had a cup of it to drink.  Anyway, he usually buys the Dunkin' Donuts brand at the grocery store (because it tastes good and doesn't cost that much) and LOVES he Starbucks (which is a very expensive habit).  I had him try this one and he said that it tastes good (actually he said that it ""taste expensive, but that it was good"").  He finished the entire bag off in no time! :)"
1959,B002TMV3CG,5,1282176000,"I was surprised just how pleasing this coffee was beyond my regular brands. It's strong, but not too edgy, full of aroma and good taste and definitely something I'll be getting again."
1960,B002TMV3CG,3,1282176000,I enjoyed this coffee. It was smooth and rich. A bit chalky if brewed too strong. 3.5
1961,B002TMV3CG,3,1282176000,"I openly admit to not being a coffee snob, with the amount of sugar and cream I add it would be hard to claim that I was very picky however I do have a few coffee's that I normally buy and like and tend to stick with medium blends. Prior to my last pregnancy I only used my french press but lately I'm back to the drip maker since its just faster and easier so I thought I'd give this pre-ground coffee a try.<br /><br />It's not bad. Granted it's not amazing either, it does have a bit stronger flavor then I'm used to but I expected that... thankfully it's just richer and not bitter which sometimes can happen with stronger coffees IMO. My mother was visiting and she prefers a very dark coffee but said that this one was acceptable (as someone who drinks her coffee black I figure she's a better judge then I am). So while I won't go out of my way to purchase this for myself it is a coffee I'd probably keep on hand for guests who like a stronger coffee."
1962,B002TMV3CG,5,1282089600,"Some coffees try to impress by including a particular strong added flavor or mixing in a variety of tastes so as to distract from the often bitter taste of the coffee itself.<br /><br />This Melitta Cafe doesn't do that.  Rather it has a very pure, direct and yes smooth taste that is surprisingly not bitter.  It is a coffee for those who enjoy sitting down with a hot beverage and enjoying the moment.  It does not grab your attention, but that's not what I'm looking for in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />The mix of dark and light roasts are very finely blended, and give the coffee a robust flavor, and a great, welcomed dose of caffeine.<br /><br />I'd definitely get this again."
1963,B002TMV3CG,3,1282003200,"Melitta European Roast Extra Dark is my daily coffee, so I should have known that this blend (Blanc et Noir) would be weaker than I'm used too.  If you don't like strong, dark, flavorful coffee, then Blanc et Noir may be a good fit for you, but if you like a little more ""strength,"" you might like the European Roast Extra Dark."
1964,B002TMV3CG,5,1281830400,"WE MADE THIS IN THE DRIP COFFEE MAKER -- SO GOOD!<br /><br />WE MADE THIS IN THE FRENCH PRESS -- TASTEY AS EVER!<br /><br />WE MADE THIS IN OUR STOVE TOP ESPRESSO MAKER -- LICKED THE CUP!<br /><br />WE MADE THIS IN MY FATHER-IN-LAW'S $2,000 ESPRESSO MAKER -- WHOA MOMMA!<br /><br />IT WAS ALL SO VERY DELICIOUS AND NOW I AM SO CAFFEINATED I THINK MY HEART IS GOING TO EXPLODE."
1965,B002TMV3CG,4,1281744000,"I love coffee, and yet I'm not the type of person who distinguishes flavors and aromas generally coffee falls into one of two categories for me - good coffee and garbage coffee.  Good coffee is generally coffee you have to pay for, you get it at a resturant or at a coffee shop, or make it at home.  Garbage coffee is generally found free from your employer.<br /><br />This stuff falls under good coffee.  I like the scent, I love the taste, and since I love my coffee extra strong, I don't need as much of it as I generally do with store bought coffees.  I took the bag to a friends house and everyone there agreed that this was an exceptionally flavorful and enjoyable coffee.<br /><br />Now the packaging on the other hand... you're not getting that bag open without scissors.  If buying for people with arthitis go ahead and buy them some scissors too otherwise they will just sit and stare longingly at the bag.<br /><br />Final opinion - yes I would pay for this coffee, and yes I enjoyed the entire bag of it - 4 stars"
1966,B002TMV3CG,5,1280966400,"This is really delicious coffee that I would recommend and buy again.  The rich aroma as it brews lets you know you're in for an excellent cup of java.  The flavor is deep and robust, a great way to start the morning."
1967,B002TMV3CG,5,1280102400,"I love dark roast coffee. There is nothing better than the smell, feel, and flavor of a good dark roast. Unfortunately, a lot of places thing ""dark"" means ""burnt"". After I've had some bad ""dark"" roast coffee, it is nice to have something a little mellower. Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir fills in nicely for those times.<br /><br />The flavor is not light roast, or dark roast. I wouldn't even really say it is somewhere in between. It is definitely not a ""Medium Roast"" like the Maxwell house some reviewers have likened it to.<br /><br />While this will not be replacing my dark roast anytime soon, Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir has earned its place in my pantry for those times when I just want something different. Not light, not dark, but somehow both."
1968,B002TMV3CG,3,1279929600,"We typically buy our coffee from Trader Joe's - it's economical, tasty and you can grind it fresh at the store. But we thought we'd check out this coffee from the German Melitta Group. It's got a good, strong flavor but there's really nothing especially memorable about it. If you're looking for a good coffee, there's really nothing to object to here - but there's also nothing to boast about. It's straight-up coffee. It's also surprisingly fresh for being pre-ground which is nice.<br /><br />As a side note, it's certified Kosher. I would think that most coffee would be Kosher, but after a little research it appears that's not something you can assume. So, if you're looking for a Kosher coffee - check this one out."
1969,B002TMV3CG,5,1279670400,My wife and I really enjoy a strong cup of coffee. This Melitta Cafe Blanc et Noir ground coffee fits our requirement perfectly. I will admit that very few exotic coffees have the ability to satisfy our taste buds. But this one does. It's rich smooth flavor and deep roasted taste is on the stronger side. I don't ever want to be able to see the bottom of my filled coffee mug. I love the taste and it has no bitter after taste. Great coffee!!
1970,B002TMV3CG,3,1279670400,"Didn't think this coffee was good or bad- just blah.  So, if it's on sale, grab it if you need cheap coffee for days when you don't demand good taste while getting your caffeine dose."
1971,B002TMV3CG,4,1279584000,"This coffee was very good at breakfast, it is low acid and brewed up in our Hamilton Beach drip machine nicely. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because it is a very fine grind, probably closer to an espresso grind than a drip but the description doesn't say that. It did work in the drip machine. I found that the best way to get a not to strong cup of coffee was to measure one teaspoon of coffee grounds less per cup then I normally would. Once I did that it made a very fine pot of coffee."
1972,B002TMV3CG,4,1279497600,"My husband and I enjoy trying various flavors/types of coffee, although we tend to prefer lighter roasts--""breakfast blend"" varieties are some of our favorites.  However, Melitta's Blanc et Noir professed to be a combination of both light and dark roasts, so I decided to take a chance on the idea that it in the balance, it would not be too dark for us.<br /><br />Turns out that I was right--the mix of light and dark roasts does produce a more medium-bodied coffee.  We found the end result (made in our drip coffee maker) to rich and smooth without being bitter.  However, I can't say that the flavor was particularly remarkable or notable; it was simply a good, decent cup of coffee.  Furthermore, although I realize that the extra fine grind is supposed to be an advantage, it means that we cannot use this coffee in our French press, which we use occasionally as an alternate to our drip coffee maker.<br /><br />In the end, this makes a nice cup of coffee, but I'm not sure that I'd choose to buy it on my own, mainly because there are other products that I prefer."
1973,B002TMV3CG,5,1279324800,"This is one of the best coffees I've had. It's smooth, rich, and full-bodied. You can brew it up very strong without bitterness or any unpleasant aftertaste. It takes cream and sugar well, but those of us who like our coffee black will enjoy the flavor.<br />It's very finely ground, and quite delicious."
1974,B002TMV3CG,3,1279324800,"I am not sure what the rationale is for combining dark and light roast coffees, as the result you get is neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good red herring, but something akin to . . . well, Maxwell House.<br /><br />I have nothing against Maxwell House, I made and drank a lot of it in my younger days as a soda jerk, but we've moved on. Distinctive coffees are the thing now.<br /><br />My terms of reference are high, since I live on Maui, where I have easy access to Kona coffee, still the very best, and a selection of estate-grown Maui and Molokai coffees that are good but not quite as good. (You may never have tasted Kona, even if you paid for it; one of the big chains for years sold more coffee as Kona than Kona ever produced.)<br /><br />I was also not a fan of the very fine grind of this coffee, which the producer claims helps bring out the full flavor. Not necessary, and I ended up having to use two Melitta filters to keep sediment out of my cup."
1975,B002TMV3CG,4,1279324800,"I thought this coffee was very good, but I drink lattes and tea more than regular coffee, so I don't necessarily trust my judgment.  As a result, I shared it with a coffee-loving colleague at work.  He brewed a pot and came back with these comments:  ""The coffee is just as yum as I remember it. I made it espresso-style today.  Melitta coffee reminds me of a morning kitchen in Germany: making coffee, slicing bread and cheese, and preparing all the jams. As it's brewing, Melitta smells like coffee should smell - none of the burning scent you often get with other coffees. As for the flavor, it is dark, rich and bold yet smooth with only a slight bitter after-taste, which I actually like. I highly recommend it, especially if you're used to Folgers or other more commercial brands."""
1976,B002TMV3CG,3,1279238400,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a bag that I received for free through the Vine program.<br /><br />It's OK, decent, not remarkable. I usually prefer dark roast, and this one is a mixed blend of dark and lighter roasts, so it's not as dark as I like it. And I usually prefer to grind my own beans, at least at home. But for a bag of pre-ground coffee that you can mail order, it's not bad. I don't know if that makes it competitive, price-wise."
1977,B002TMV3CG,3,1279152000,My first try at a mixed blend.  The aroma is good and taste is fine.  But what is not here is much character.  It does not make for a memorable cup.  So as others have said it's good but not great.  Melitta's Columbian may be a much better place if you are new to this brand.
1978,B002TMV3CG,4,1279152000,"In the interest of being objective I must first state that I am fond of at least two other Melitta products: The European Roast and Melitta's unbleached #2 filter cones. I'm not one usually taken by fru-fru coffees, so I wasn't expecting much before trying Blanc et Noir. But I was most surprised at the taste - midway between my usual Melitta dark roast and most-favored chocolate Vietnamese #1. This is an interesting blend that will satisfy. I just wish that manufacturers would still with an honest pound, instead of manipulating ounce measurements to extract profitability - this coffee comes in slightly over 11-ounce bags."
1979,B002TMV3CG,3,1279152000,"This coffee is good, it's just a little strong for the strength I usually drink!"
1980,B002TMV3CG,5,1279152000,"I am a coffee snob of sorts. When I received this ""Blanc et Noir"" coffee from Melitta, I was ready to be underwhelmed. I was totally positively surprised! The very tightly sealed package kept the pre-ground coffee fresh until opening. The fine grind is suitable for cone and similar drip coffee makers. My normal brew is Peet's dark roast (French, Italian Espresso, etc.) and so I added a bit more coffee to test out the B&E blend. It came out full, rich and smooth. It is definitely a medium by my taste, but it is not a wimpy tasting coffee. it has a full and rich coffee flavor without being bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />Now if you really, really like the off the charts dark roast coffee, this is not the one for you. I am still likely to buy a lot more Peet's in my life. However, I will probably also get some more Melitta as a result of this test because it is a very satisfying coffee to have with breakfast or other food. It is strong enough that I still feel like I've had coffee, but not so strong that I am finishing the whole pot myself due to elimination of all other takers. In other words, you can serve it for a mixed taste crew of coffee drinkers and everyone is likely to be satisfied to one extent or another. In fact, the majority (I think I am fringe) are going to be actually impressed.<br /><br />One note: You have to cut the top of the package to open it. It will not just pull apart like many vacuum packed coffee bags. If you cut the package just between the wire re-sealing closure and the seal at the top of the bag, you should be fine with it."
1981,B002TMV3CG,3,1279152000,"If you're a fan of darker roasts, there's not much to dislike about ""Blanc et Noir"" from Melitta -- not much that I could detect, anyway. On the other hand, there wasn't a lot to set it apart from other similarly-priced dark roasts on the market. It is a perfectly serviceable coffee I was happy to have in my rotation for a week or two. But it won't displace, say, the coffee I brought back from a recent Hawaii vacation as my weekends-and-special-occasions choice, nor did it evoke all the memories of European cafes the marketing promised. But as I said, it's not a bad choice by any means if darker beans are your thing."
1982,B002TMV3CG,3,1278979200,"A good, smooth coffee. While better than many brands, it still isn't as good as regular Chock Full o Nuts and certainly not worth the price. In my opinion, anyway."
1983,B002TMV3CG,5,1278979200,"I was wary of this coffee before I first brewed some, because I usually find that anything described as a 'dark roast' has a bitter taste to it.  But I really liked this blend -- it makes a fairly dark coffee, but I couldn't taste a trace of bitterness or a ""burnt"" flavor.  Maybe that is because it is blended with a mild roast?  Who knows.  Anyway, I would definitely buy this again...makes a great morning cup of coffee: strong but not bitter.<br /><br />Note: It is very finely ground, so you may actually want to use a bit less of it than with regular ground coffee.  Also, it would NOT work in a French Press coffee maker (which needs a course grind)."
1984,B002TMV3CG,4,1278979200,"Rating a coffee product is difficult because it's so highly personal.  This produces a pleasant cup, something I would not hesitate to serve to anyone.  Why four stars? I have a rather acute reaction to anything approaching a bitter taste -- and I found that this has the slightly bitter aftertaste one finds in many French roasts.  Served with food, I doubt I would notice it, but, served alone, it is more apparent."
1985,B002TMV3CG,4,1278892800,"I don''t consider myself to be a coffee snob; I'll drink 3 hour sludge left over from the office pot. On the other hand, when I want a good cup of coffee, I want it strong, aromatic, and flavorful. This particular offering was aromatic, quite flavorful, but I can't give it the full 5 stars because it was a bit weak. To achieve the strength I like, I needed to use more coffee than I should."
1986,B002TMV3CG,4,1278720000,"Melitta's Blanc et Noir is a recommended solution for a busy lifestyle. The main benefit is that you don't have to spend time grinding coffee beans: just measure what you need and go.<br /><br />As with all coffees, you might have to experiment a bit with the serving size - I am trending towards using more coffee than directed to get the flavor I want - but the bottom line is that no matter how you measure or serve this ground coffee, you'll be rewarded with a flavorful, but not bitter cup that tastes great with or without cream and sugar (I've tried both). I think any time-challenged person who enjoys good coffee should give Blanc et Noir a try!"
1987,B002TMV3CG,4,1278633600,"To start off, I'm not a coffee drinker.  I got this coffee for DH, who is a Major coffee drinker so it's really his review.  According to DH, this coffee is Perfectly roasted.  Much better tasting that that over-roasted coffee from Starbucks.  The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that DH says the coffee is very finely ground and doesn't work very well in his coffee maker.  However, it would be excellent for an espresso maker."
1988,B002TMV3CG,4,1278547200,"There is no doubt about the fact that I enjoy a brisk cup of coffee everyday in the morning. But, there just hasn't been the most definitive taste that I've ever tasted. Still, Melitta which makes great coffee filters, and excellent tastes of coffee. Yet, I did get to try a nice cup of their Blanc et Noir coffee blend, and it really isn't bad. While it doesn't seperate itself from most of the stronger flavors, it still tastes pretty good. While it isn't as strong as Maxwell House or Chock Full O' Nuts in ground blends, the Melitta Blanc et Noir does flow into its own. If you're looking for a nice alternative to any ordinary brand, than this would be a great option.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B"
1989,B002TMV3CG,5,1278460800,"This coffee really surprised me. It was flavorful and very smooth. There was no bitterness to it (something that I really dislike in coffee).<br /><br />I used just a little more with this than my usual scoop amounts.<br /><br />We usually drink some version of Costco's Starbucks brew or Dunkin' Donuts.<br /><br />I liked the Melitta Blanc et Noir better than anything else we've had in years.<br /><br />It is already ground, fairly fine too but it brewed well in our cone filter coffee maker."
1990,B002TMV3CG,5,1278460800,"Whereas most coffee blends involve a blend of different coffee bean varieties, this blend features a range of different roasts. I suppose it also includes different varieties but the label tells us nothing in that regard. We are only told it includes both light and dark roasts, thus the name which translates as ""White and Black"". The taste, of course, combines the features of both roasts and is an interesting, mild flavor with only slight acidity. I drank it black with nothing added in a variation of the French press method to get the full impression. The grind is very fine which is the most preferred these days, especially for a drip process. The fine grind might be a problem for those using unfiltered methods, such as percolator or even the French press which uses a crude metal filter(I like my coffee unfiltered). This coffee is a great choice for coffee connoisseurs."
1991,B002TMV3CG,3,1278288000,My husband did not care for it at all. I thought it was okay but nothing I would pay extra for. I think you definitely need to use more of the coffee than the directions call for or else it is really not that flavorful. I will probably end up mixing it with a can of my regular coffee and finishing off the bag that way.
1992,B002TMV3CG,4,1278288000,"I'm a coffee drinker that prefers to grind my own beans because it is fresher that way. The more recently it was roasted the better. I like dark, hearty coffees, but not ones that have been over-roasted. A select few ground coffees can be good, and this is one of them. Melitta strikes a nice balance between the light and dark roasts. The dark roast predominates but the light roast helps make it smooth and flavorful. This is a fine grind and makes a more potent pot of coffee than similar amounts of your standard ground coffees like Foldgers or Maxwell House.<br /><br />They've priced this mid-range coffee competitively and I would recommend it to people who appreciate a flavorful, aromatic coffee. It cannot replace just roasted and freshly ground coffee, but you'd be hard pressed to find something much better outside of a gourmet shop. I've used Melitta's filters for years, and now I'm enjoying their coffees as well. Because of the Blanc et Noir Ground blend, I tried their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GTO"">Colombian Medium Roast</a> and found it to be quite good as well."
1993,B002TMV3CG,2,1278201600,"I am a coffee addict or connoisseur if you prefer a more genteel description. I will not turn down any coffee as a rule, and my only motto is ""the stronger the better"".<br />That being said, I grind my beans in a burr grinder and have found a great brand of premeasured and preground coffee for the drip machine, and have tried more than my share of brands looking for that elusive coffee perfection. I typically go through at least one handmade latte each day and a pot of drip brew a day. Yikes! I tried this brand in both machines. I think the advertised concept, a blend of light and dark roasts is a great idea; it's something that I do myself and it makes a nicely balanced cup. Upon opening the attractive package, coffee smelled great, and I measured the usual amount for espresso. The finely ground Melitta ground beans produced crema (that means they were fresh) and before I added steamed and frothed milk, I tasted the brew. It was fine, but nothing special. Upon adding the milk the flavor really diminished and it was kind of grainy and grassy...not very appealing. To be fair, I then made a batch in the drip machine according to package description. While the espresso made with the Melitta was acceptable, the drip coffee was frankly horrible. It tasted burnt, harsh, and acidic, without any well-rounded smoothness. This is a coffee with a lovely art deco package, but not much else to recommend it. Let's just say, if I was stranded in the desert it wouldn't be half-bad. Otherwise, I'll take my tried and true coffee."
1994,B002TMV3CG,5,1278201600,"UPDATE JANUARY 2011<br />I am now a pretty regular drinker of this stuff! In fact, I just ordered some more and I note the price has gone down which makes it very afforable, take in the free shipping, and it's an absolutely delicious  steal!<br /><br />I am really enjoying this Coffee. I usually drink Folgers at home and have done so for nearly 20 years. This was a pleasant surprise, the aroma as it was brewing was scintillating, the taste (with my regular creamer and sugar) was a treat for my taste buds.<br />I finished two cups and was tempted to drink more because it was such a smooth tasting coffee. I used 6 heaped tea-spoon fulls for make 8 cups (as marked on my coffee maker) and it worked out just about right for me; though some hard line coffee drinkers make like it stronger than that!<br />The package itself was a little hard to open, I found the best way was to cut the top off with scissors and use the metal bands on the package to securely close it as airtight as possible.<br /><br />This a really nice coffee but the only way to be sure you will like it is to try it."
1995,B002TMV3CG,4,1278201600,"My taste is usually for bold coffees and nothing French roasted.  I prefer Colombians and Sumatras, and various blends such as Fresh Market's Tres Rios.  However, I also keep the cheap can of Folgers around for when I'm too lazy to grind, and while it's not great, it's certainly acceptable.  The Melitta Blanc et Noir on that scale is far higher than the Folgers, but not among my favorites.  I don't see myself ever pining after it the way I would if I hadn't had my favorites in a while.  Blanc et Noir bills itself as its literal translation Light and Dark, and by blending these two I think it takes away some from the tastes of both.  It does serve as a richer breakfast type coffee if the typical light breakfast blend is too bland or weak for your taste."
1996,B002TMV3CG,4,1277856000,This is good coffee...I think it is just short of 5-start rating.  The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast. Bold coffee drinkers could probably make it stronger and enjoy a bold taste due to the fine grinding. I don't think any coffee drinkers will be displeased with this roast.  We made a pot for a dinner party and everyone gave it the thumbs up!
1997,B002TMV3CG,4,1277856000,"Nice strong and dark flavor without the bitterness.  I found it taste even better with half cream than milk or soya milk, which kinda mellowed the deep flavor.  I really enjoyed the coffee with two full scoop full (it is ground coffee) with a French press.  The package comes a press seal and a metal wrap to seal in the freshness.  Highly recommend that you keep it in the fridge once open and should use within 2 weeks.  Loved it."
1998,B002TMV3CG,5,1277769600,I like a smooth rich cup of coffee.  The Melita Blanc et Noir delivers.  It's one of the best ground coffees that I've purchased and is easily comparable to coffee from one of the better specialty stores.  The coffee arrived vacuum packed and tightly sealed.  At $0.55 per ounce ($8.80 per pound) it's also competitively priced.<br /><br />Strongly Recommended.
1999,B002TMV3CG,4,1277769600,"When I read the name of this coffee, I figured that a mix of light and dark roasts would simply taste like a medium roast. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I was mistaken. As a blend of light and dark roast, this coffee has some distinct attributes that a medium roast can't achieve by itself.<br /><br />The flavor of this coffee leans strongly toward the dark side. The taste is full and slightly bitter, but it's not over-roasted like some dark coffees. However, the light roast comes across in the aftertaste, which is relatively mild. I find the transition from a strong flavor going down to a more subtle aftertaste to be rare, and this makes for a very interesting coffee.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the quality of this coffee, and am certain that most coffee enthusiasts would give it a thumbs up. Of course, it may not be everyone's favorite, but it's definitely worth a try. I would definitely get it again!"
2000,B002TMV3CG,4,1277683200,"I freely admit I like my coffee strong.  That's how I learned to drink it and that's how I make it.  So let me lead off by saying that I have one quibble with Melitta's coffee, but it's fixable:  If brewed according to the instructions on the bag, it's Church Coffee, a thin, bitter brew that doesn't do justice to the rather good coffee in the bag.<br /><br />I was careful, I read the instructions several times just to make sure that it was two teaspoons per six ounces of water, not two tablespoons, which is roughly what I use.  But no, Melitta insists you use two teaspoons, and so I thought ""Fair enough, I'll do it their way.""  That was a mistake.  While it wasn't undrinkable, it sure wasn't anything to write home about.  I will say that it made decent iced coffee later that evening, which did go a long way to improving my opinion of it.<br /><br />The next day I made it my way, and I have to say that it's really excellent coffee.  It's smooth and flavorful without a hint of bitterness.  And the iced coffee was even better this time.  I've always enjoyed Melitta coffee, and I think their Blanc et Noir is a very nice addition to their line.  It's particularly attractive at the price it's being offered at here.  But use it with the caveat that the instructions may not yield the best possible cup of coffee for your taste.  Don't be afraid to play with the measurements."
2001,B002TMV3CG,5,1277683200,"As the name implies, this is a blended cup. I like this kind of coffee. This is not roasted like French Roast or even Italian roast. This veers more to the flavor that you might expect at Dunkin' Donuts. It is drinkable. It is a ""session coffee"" - the kind that you can enjoy, and then not worry if you want to have a second cup.<br /><br />The challenge for this kind of coffee is that it doesn't become bitter if you put too much in your filter. I made this with a Melitta filter, in a Melitta maker. I'm satisfied. There is a strong finish to this coffee, but even at a higher strength, it won't overshoot.<br /><br />I used to work in a fine hotel restaurant. We served a rich but mellow cup. This is that kind of drink. I know it says ""Blanc et Noir,"" but it is not cowboy coffee or even Midwestern diner coffee. This is a cup that you would serve to guests without reservation.<br /><br />I drink coffee with a blend of half-and-half and 2 percent milk, and often with a bit of sugar. Many mornings, I reach for French Roast and I make it fuertissimo. So, perhaps my sense of ""strong"" is unusual. But, I think you could do fine with just milk on this coffee. It probably wouldn't handle too much cream."
2002,B002TMV3CG,4,1277683200,"Is great coffee in your cup...  Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee doesn't quite make it as great coffee, but it is very good coffee. I compare it to something similar one would receive at a good, four-star hotel - it beats the coffee served at fund-raising socials, but doesn't compare to the fine coffees grown in Kona, Hawaii.<br /><br />If you follow the directions, using only 2 teaspoons of ground coffee per 6 oz. cup, you will find this a pleasant, smooth brew with which to start your morning or to keep you going into that long night.  There is none of the burnt taste some of the darker roasts are prone to having, no bitter after-taste, and no acidic flavor to this coffee.  However, if you make the mistake I initially did - yes, I didn't read the directions but used the same measurements I always do - and use 3 teaspoons per cup, you will find this an unpleasantly strong brew.  This is a coffee I would definitely serve to friends and family.<br /><br />Melita Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee is a good value for anyone who wants something better than the grocery store carries, but doesn't want to go broke purchasing coffee for home brewing.  Because it uses 1/3 less coffee, due to its fine grind, one gets approximately as many cups of coffee as would be obtained from regular grind sold in one pound bags."
2003,B002TMV3CG,5,1277683200,"I love this coffee, and I would definitely buy it again. After reading a few other reviews, I think that's because I like my coffee flavorful (and not bitter), but not overly bold. This coffee has a full but subtle flavor that carries just a hint of dark beans (or French roast), but it's just a hint, not overwhelming. Very smooth: It would be easy to drink cup after cup. My only criticism is that the packaging was not as easy to open as some other coffees I drink; next time, I'll start with a pair of scissors.<br /><br />But I do plan to purchase more of this coffee; I recommend it to others with coffee taste similar to mine."
2004,B002TMV3CG,3,1277596800,"I'm a thrifty person, and I usually buy store brand foods, but coffee is the one item we really splurge on in our house. I've recently become really picky about my coffee. I work from home, so I don't hit up Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts on the way to work. I used to be able to literally drink ANY coffee, and wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Now I can barely stomach what I used to drink, like Folgers. These days I buy Starbucks beans and grind them at home, or use the self serve dispensers at the grocery store that are organic or green mountain brand.<br /><br />This Melitta coffee didn't disgust me, but I wouldn't start buying it exclusively as a replacement for the coffee we currently drink. When I asked my boyfriend his thoughts on the Melitta he said it was good, kinda of nutty. Then I asked him if I could replace the Starbucks beans and instantly a big emphatic ""NO!"" came flying out of his mouth. No consideration what-so-ever that this could be a replacement. I find it to be a mild blend, not really enough flavor for me. I tend to like the bold beans like French Roast.<br /><br />It will do in a pinch but I don't really think I'll purchase Melitta in the future."
2005,B002TMV3CG,5,1277596800,Very rich and full body coffee worth every effort in seeking out at your local grocery store. Perhaps one of the best commercial coffee's available in the mass market today!
2006,B002TMV3CG,3,1277596800,"I love Melitta products. Even use the now almost antique ceramic coffee cone to brew cups individually (they're better brewed that way).  I also admit to being a coffee snob and someone who is qualified to judge the flavor and worth of a brewed cup of ""the nectar of the gods.""  So I was hopeful that the Blanc et Noir would score higher than the Creme Brulee which I recently reviewed..<br /><br />While better than the Creme Brulee, I felt the Blanc et Noir lacked the full-bodied flavor I come to associate with rich, premium coffee.  I normally use three heaping measures (special pewter Melitta coffee measure) for a 10-12 oz. cup, because I prefer a full-flavor brew and my preparation of Blanc et Noir was done in this manner.  What should have been a rich and smooth brew was in actuality an acidic ""thin"" tasting coffee that rated slightly above average but not by much.  I realize I am spoiled by purchasing whole beans and grinding them prior to use.  I feel pre-ground coffee does not keep that freshness, so this is partially a factor.  But that aside, Blanc et Noir is not a coffee I would purchase again.<br /><br />As with my review of Creme Brulee, I am disappointed to give Blanc et Noir a less than stellar report, however, search further.  There are better brews on the market."
2007,B002TMV3CG,3,1277510400,"Not a bad cup of Joe. Smooth, medium roast flavor and smells divine and I preferred it to Starbucks. (I do not like the taste of burnt beans.) Only one little problem, I did a taste test with this up against Kroeger store brand coffee a generic.<br /><br />This was almost a dead tie. the flavor and density was comparable with the only obvious difference being that the finer ground of the Melitta meant that it was less acidic and didn't upset my stomach as much after my 4th cup. Unfortunately the disparity in price can be depressing and makes the Kroeger brand appear more reasonable to my budget.<br /><br />Too bad, I do like this coffee."
2008,B002TMV3CG,3,1277510400,"I love my coffee and I order my own from a coffee dealer.  I usually grind my own beans for the freshest taste.  I was anxious to try the Melitta Cafe when I saw it was available.  I understand that there are other Melitta blends besides the lighter French style that I received.<br /><br />My reaction to French roast coffee was reaffirmed when I tried this coffee.  That slightly burnt, bitter taste was there and, while it was minimized somewhat, I found myself disappointed.  I had that for my morning coffee and my afternoon coffee and I was going to do the same the next day.  However, I decided that I really didn't want any more of the Melitta so I switched back to the coffee I had been drinking before.  I think that those who like Franch roast coffee will enjoy this product.  As for me, I will pass.  But, hey, what do I know.  I mean, I still have most of the Blue Mountain coffee I bought in Jamaica sitting on the shelf because I didn't it was all that great."
2009,B002TMV3CG,5,1277510400,"Let me start by saying that I am someone who enjoys a good cup of coffee, but by no means am I a 'coffee expert' in the analytical sense. For instance: it would be impossible for me to tell if a certain batch of coffee were from Columbia rather than Hawaii without looking at the packaging; however, that level of discrimination is not, in my experience, necessary for me to enjoy either or both varieties. My taste buds know what they like; and they, in concert with my eyes and nose, provide me with all the information I need to make a determination concerning the quality of the coffee being served to me.<br /><br />Melitta has done a great job of packaging their Gourmet Coffee Cafe' Collection, giving it a subdued yet elegant appearance that beckons one to take a closer look. Opening the bag and testing the aroma I was able to tell that this was no off-the-shelf everyday coffee: my impression was of a full-bodied coffee but without the overpowering smell of a dark roast. Time to put my coffee maker into action. Blanc Et Noir is a combination of dark and light roast coffees which should theoretically have the same flavor as a medium roast; however, this is definitely not the case as I was able to detect the dark roast as well as the mellowing influence of the light roast. I drank my first cup black and was pleased at the lack of bitterness. My second cup was with cream and sugar. Both ways produced a wonderfully flavorful cup of coffee that I enjoyed completely. This would be the perfect coffee to serve to guests, or to pamper oneself with while reading a good book."
2010,B002TMV3CG,4,1277337600,"As a coffee fiend who drinks anywhere from 5 to 10 cups a day, I can heartily recommend Melitta Cafe's Noir Ground Coffee. I'm a bit surprised that I like it because I'm a diehard Maxwell House, Chock Full o' Nuts kind of guy who tends to shun the overly fancy coffee that I believe appeals primarily to yuppies (or whatever the current equivalent of a yuppy is). You know, those who like Starbucks, as I don't, and think coffee should have foam (it most definitely should not). Melitta Cafe's Noir Ground Coffee isn't anything like that. It's just good, full-bodied, robust coffee for those of us who have been drinking this beverage all our lives.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks"
2011,B002TMV3CG,5,1277337600,"I like my coffee normally flavored, but I figure 'Try something else'.  And sure enough, I was not disappointed.  The coffee is very smooth, bold but not too much so, and has enough caffeine to get me started.  A very satisfying and enjoyable cup of coffee that I can only recommend to any coffee lover!!!"
2012,B002TMV3CG,4,1277337600,"First, our family drinks an almost absurd amount of coffee.  I pull 10 to 20 espresso shots on a typical day, mostly lattes and frappucino drinks.  Occasionally, we make drip.  For reference, I won't even drink ""office"" grade coffee or typical garbage like Folgers.  I would rather drink a glass of water or a good tea.  So, I am rather familiar with good coffee and probably more demanding than most reviewers here.<br /><br />As a result, I would rate Melitta Blanc et Noir just OK.  It's average.  It is more bitter and acidic than I would like.  It is maybe comparable to Starbuck's coffee which isn't that great.  It is definitely better than many store/house brands.  However, there are some good to great coffees out there including Millstone, Cost Plus' varieties, Peet's, and Illy, the latter, especially being frighteningly expensive.  I do, however, encourage you to try Illy as it has a fantastic, reusable tin.<br /><br />With all that, I give it a bump to 4 stars.  That is because, here at Amazon, especially with their subscription program, it is cheap.  You would probably not notice the difference in frou-frou'ed up drinks with a lot of cream and sugar.  Also, it deserves 4 stars because it is somewhat interesting.  Blanc et Noir is a blend of dark French roast and a light roast.  I expected it to be some middling blend in between, but actually you do get a sense of both the mild roast and the more full, smoky darker roast.  It is interesting, but I'm not sure I'd like it over and over.  I prefer more single bean roasts like a good Columbian Supremo or a well-blended house.<br /><br />Finally, it is listed as ""Extra Fine Grind"".  It is very, very evenly ground which is impressive, but it is not that extra fine.  I would say more of just fine.  It is definitely way too coarse to use in an espresso machine, even with a pressurized portafilter.<br /><br />This product is worth a try, and also be sure to pick up a can of Illy (even for the tin) and try some good Columbian Supremo if you haven't already.  These are good reference coffees, and I made a bunch of A/B tests among them and a couple others before writing this review."
2013,B002TMV3CG,5,1277337600,we like strong flavored coffee and this really fills the bill.<br />tastes good and isn't bitter. i will definitely buy more.
2014,B002TMV3CG,4,1277337600,"I drink good coffee, black, nearly everyday. I usually purchase Tully's, Starbucks, Seattle's Best, etc. ground (occasionally beans). I normally prefer bold blends but will sometimes go with a lighter coffee just for variety's sake. I brew my coffee drip using a non-bleached filter.<br /><br />This Melitta proved to be a nice bold blend that I enjoyed very much. I found it to be comparable with my normal coffee and at $6 per bag it is priced a little below what I would normally pay at my local QFC.<br /><br />Recommended."
2015,B002TMV3CG,4,1277337600,"I'm sitting here this morning having a cup of Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir as I peruse the paper and facebook and look for goodies on Amazon. Let me just say that I really like this fine blend of the dark and light coffees. What you get is a coffee that's very drinkable with or without cream, as light on the palate as any American breakfast coffee. Yet there are wonderful subdued flavors of the darker and richer coffees one might expect down at the local coffee shop. My normal cup of home-brew is something along the lines of Starbucks Cafe Estima or Sumatra, so I do like the heavier, darker brews. And this Blanc et Noir just hints at those beans in a beverage which is smooth and aromatic and suitable for nearly every occasion. If you like the flavors of the darker brews but find the full-bore coffees sometimes overpowering, this is the blend for you. Blanc et Noir finishes with mild tones of citrus. Very nice."
2016,B002TMV3CG,5,1277337600,"This coffee scored well when compared over a few days use with the coffees we normally use, also premium coffees. First, if you are looking for a great iced coffee, look no further.  This makes the best iced coffee, bar none. Second, my husband and I both like a strong, robust, on the dark side coffee, fine ground and black with no cream or other additions.  The price we pay for this preference is that we often go too far over the edge into bitterness.  This coffee, by blending the light with the dark, gets around this potential bitterness factor better than any coffee we've used.  We will be buying this again as right now it is in first place with us."
2017,B002TMV3CG,4,1277337600,"I have long been a fan of German based Melitta products, and found their coffee to be far superior to most of the mainstream popular coffees, and even some so called ""exclusive"" or ""select"" blends.<br />Blanc et Noir is one selection from their Cafe Collection, which I would put in the medium to dark roast catagory.<br />A full bodied flavor without acidity, but not too strong. That is when made in French press, I don't use old style ""leave it in the pot all day"" machines.<br />A lot of people have switched to the pod type or single cup brewing systems lately, and in fact coffee consumption seems down in general, in favor of herb teas and non caffeinated drinks. So it was nice to go back to an old style ground coffee taste.<br />If you like European style ground coffees, you may also like to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CJJKRU"">Douwe Egberts Intense - Real Coffee Dark Roast Ground Coffee, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)</a> which is Dutch, or the bold flavored <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIRCU"">Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung Coffee, 8.81-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />Another point worth mentioning is cost, these value packs here work out pretty cheap compared to pod systems bags or cups, and are even not that bad compared to everyday grocery store prices. When compared to gourmet stores like Gevalia, they are a steal, and great quality."

This kit includes:<br /><br />Sushi Chef Cookbook<br />Short-grain Rice<br />Nori for wrapping the sushi<br />Pickled Ginger<br />Spicy Wasabi Horseradish<br />Dark Soy Sauce<br />Rice Vinegar<br />Sushi Vinegar<br />Rice Paddle<br />Bamboo Mat for rolling-up your creations<br /><br />I had a blast creating my own sushi!
2029,B000H241DS,4,1239753600,"This kit includes all the dry components to make sushi, and its a great starter kit.  However, I was disappointed by the book that was included.  I expected a book with colorful pictures and a variety of different types of sushis you can make, etc.  The book was not easily organized and not colorful, and only included a few sushi recipees.  I would recommend getting another book to supplement your sushi making desires."
2030,B000H241DS,5,1090368000,"This kit is a great gift idea and a really good way to start making yer very own bonafide sushi -- both nigiri (rice ball) and maki (roll). All you need is an expert fish buyer, a knife that is sharp as h**l, and some itty bitty little bowls for soy sauce. Everything else is IN THE BOX. Sushi Chef brand soy sacue is the best soy sauce you ever had, IMHO.<br /><br />The little instruction booklet is great. Of course, this kit is no substitute for years of apprenticeship with a Tokyo master chef, but, if you have some appreciation for the aesthetic of sushi and a flare for D.I.Y. and access to sushi-grade fish, then this is the kit for you."
2031,B000H241DS,3,1289174400,"It's an ok set if you don't want to go out and buy these very basic ingredients and two simple tools (bamboo mat and wooden spatula) on your own for a lot less.  This REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE A SMALL JAR OF TOASTED SESEME SEEDS for the money you are paying but doesn't!<br /><br />But it does get you started and will allow you to make some basic sushi.  Like other people have said the cookbook included is just terrible!!  It talks about toasting the nori even though the package of nori already says ""toasted nori""!  The cookbook is just terrible.  In trying to follow it to the letter for making the rice I burned the hell out of it!  But you learn what you realy need to do quickly.<br /><br />Bottom line the cookbook included is about the worst cookbook ever written, the ""kit"" could be gotten for half as much or less, and it should have included sesame seeds.. Still a decent gift and will get you started."
2032,B000H241DS,5,1255824000,"I have been a sushi fan for many years, but have always been shy about making it myself.  After searching online at the dozens of different options, I decided to go with the Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Too many sushi kits out there offer just the rolling mat, or dishes and the rolling mat, but no spoon, or all the dishes but no edible components.<br /><br />With this kit, you have the mat, the spoon, and all the edibles necessary sans the actual fillings (fish, veggies, etc.)  And not only does the kit have edible components, they are top notch.  The wasabi is scorchingly spicy, the rice vinegar is tangy, and the rice cooks and clumps together with ease.  The soy sauce and wasabi are so good, in fact, that I would go out of my way to buy them if I saw them at a store somewhere.<br /><br />But, the best part of this kit is the manual.  It's straightforward, written in simple English, and has very nice photos.  As I read each page of instructions, I feel like I'm being walked through step-by-step by a close friend.  I made darned good sushi my very first try.<br /><br />Criticisms?  Hmmm... not many.  The price is right.  Maybe it'd be nice if they had a special ""sushi knife"" or something enclosed, but whatever.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking to make sushi at home for the first time, you won't be sorry with this purchase."
2033,B000H241DS,2,1301788800,I believe this product is good for the beginner and is helpful however when I received mine the two bottles of vinegar were not sealed properly and the wasabi seal was clearly broken. I do not fault amazon as they quickly provided me with a refund. Other than that i think the product was helpful especially the bamboo mat for rolling the sushi.
2034,B000H241DS,2,1293494400,I bought this as a present for a very good friend. Because of the price I paid for it I was expecting something really nice. I was very disappointed to see that the kit was made up of very cheap items that if bought individually will come up to 1/3 of the price. The kit contains mainly ingredients not sushi making equipment. I would suggest that you look around for a better more reasonable set.
2035,B000H241DS,3,1270598400,"The kit gave us the kick in the butt we needed to start making our own sushi, but if we had really sat down and thought about it, we could have saved about half just buying the stuff ourself. You can buy most of what you need at your local grocery store.  Would I recommend this product?  Only if you are lazy like us!"
2036,B000H241DS,5,1173744000,"I really love this kit!  I use it once a day for lunch and it's also a favorite of my daughter.  All the products are high quality (in fact when I needed to replace them I bought some cheap stuff and then ended up going back for the more expensive....believe me, don't skimp).  I love the fact that it breaks everything down in the instructions.  If you are new to making sushi, I suggest this kit.  I am 100x faster and better that when I started as a novice."
2037,B000H241DS,3,1294790400,"I would buy this again, with a caveat. Some of the parts of this kit were of poor quality. The Nori, seaweed for rolling, was of poor quality, brittle and broken and unusable.  The instructions are adequate.  The kit includes everything and is a good place to start. If it were not for a few poor quality parts, I would give it a 5 star. Use Saran wrap on your roller and life will be easier. Following instructions for rice came close to burning rice  instructions not fully complete, limp recipes.  I wanted something all in one to start out, and this provided it, found out some of the components were of poor or mediocre quality."
2038,B000H241DS,5,1171584000,"This is a great set with all of the ingredients needed to make sushi, besides the fresh items. The items in the kit are good for multiple sushi making sessions. The only improvement would be to include more Nori, as there was only enough to make sushi for four one time. The kit comes with a recipe book which has clear directions and many sushi ideas. I would definately buy this kit again."
2039,B000H241DS,3,1340841600,"This is a basic kit that may be of use to a beginner living in the sushi wilderness--away from large cities with Asian stores or even supermarkets that regularly carry Asian cooking ingredients. But if you have access to such locally, this kit is a waste of money. The most functional part of the kit is the ""sushi mat"", which is a collection of bamboo ""straws"" lined up and tied together to provide a rollable surface to make maki rolls. The rice spatula is a useful device, but the two of these together should cost about $2, although some supermarkets charge up to $5-7 for the privilege. The rest of the items--mainly food ingredients--are low quality and preservative laden. For half the price of the kit, one could pick up a tube of prepared wasabi (doesn't last as long as the powder but is usually more potent and easier to deal with) or a small can of powder (both about $3 each), a bottle of basic Kikkoman soy sauce (far higher quality even in the basic supermarket variety--will set you back between $2 and $4, depending on location and promotions). A pack of nori sheets will set you back another $5-6, unless you only shop at Whole Foods. The most expensive item might be the rice vinegar--pretty much any Japanese or pseudo-Japanese brand will do (Nakano [same as Mizkan], Mitsukan, and Marukan are the most common). With soy sauce and with vinegar, it's important to get the Japanese, not the Chinese varieties, as the flavors and concentrations will differ. The vinegar should always be unseasoned--then follow almost any internet recipe for seasoning sushi rice. Seasoned vinegars tend to be overflavored (salt, sugar) and are generally less desirable, although they will do in a pinch. Ideally, you should have a bottle of mirin (usually billed as ""rice wine"") on hand, but can either skip it entirely and add a touch more vinegar or use dry sherry in small quantities. The packaged pickled ginger (gari), including the one in the kit, is often an overly sour, cough-syrup-tasting mess. Unless you are going to make your own, you might as well skip it entirely. The enclosed rice is short grain, but not a high-quality sushi variety. You can just as well do with commercial short-grain rice (avoid long-grain or perfumed rice, such as basmati or jasmine). If you can get a hold of one of the Japanese brands (all grown in California!), so much the better.<br /><br />Aside from preparing the rice, you really don't need a cookbook and paying about $20 extra for it is really not a worthwhile exercise. The beauty of sushi is that you can pick and choose the ingredients that go in as ""stuffing"". If you don't like raw fish, there are plenty of raw vegetables and cooked ingredients that you can find. If raw fish is your bag, be careful where you buy it and how you store it--some regulations require sushi-grade fish to be deep-frozen once, then thawed properly before sale. If this is not done properly, the flesh will be off-color, watery and fibrous, as if after a freezer-burn. Supermarket grade raw salmon is not a good substitute either, as it is not handled with proper standards of cleanliness for sushi-grade fish. Avoid lake fish, as they often contain parasites (killed in proper cooking). When out of options, you can always use smoked salmon from a supermarket, other kinds of smoked fish or imitation crab flakes. The best option may be a lightly seared tuna steak, but these are very expensive. Fresh-caught saltwater fish is usually OK. Vegetables can be raw or cooked, but they should be cut into 1/4"" strips for use in maki rolls (or sliced diagonally for nigiri). Assembly is simple--for nigiri, just make an oblong rice ""ball"" from seasoned rice assemble all the ""toppings"" in reverse order on one hand, pick up the rice ball with the other, then join them together and lightly crimp the toppings on top of the rice. You can use a small dollop of wasabi as a binder, placing it on top of the rice ball before attaching the toppings. If maki assembly instructions don't come with your sushi mat, all you need to know is that the layer of rice should be about 1/4"" thick and the ""toppings"" or ""stuffing"" go across the mat, closer to the edge from which you start rolling. Also, leave about 1/2"" of nori uncovered, so that you can seal the edge once the maki is rolled up. It is quite common to line the sushi mat with two layers of plastic wrap (on both sides!) to simplify the process (and, in some cases, to satisfy sanitary regulations--not applicable at home). Other than the amount, there are really no limits on toppings, as long as they are not liquid.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the kit is serviceable, but with middling or low quality ingredients. It will do in a pinch, but is overpriced and somewhat overhyped. Don't expect to come up with sushi-bar-quality rolls from it, but if you're a novice, this makes for a good introduction."
2040,B000H241DS,4,1272672000,"First things first, this is a great kit.  My girlfriend and I love sushi and love to try new cooking.  So I thought that this would be a great idea.  And it was. We had so much fun creating our own rolls with ease, and produced a very edible california roll on our first attempt.  The only thing I would recomend is take where you live into consideration.  We live in a small town where there is no asian food markets(within two to three hours) and where we get our fish is from the local Albertsons. Granted, we bought a tuna steak, that the butcher told me was sushi grade, and it turned out really good for cheap, but the other sushi grade fish that I would like to have is not available, such as eel or soft shelled crab or any type of fish eggs.<br /><br />In short on our first sushi night we created two cali rolls, a spicy tuna, our own twist on a philly roll, and a makeshift tempura roll.  All with the kit and some items from the store.  And all were really good.  But my favorites arent do-able, like unagi or a rainbow roll or anything with masago because of where we live. So just think about it.<br /><br />But great gift idea for cheap, or for a relationship date night item. We had so much fun"
2041,B000H241DS,5,1236038400,Got this just a week ago so I could send hubby with better lunches for work. I love the kit. Everything in it is delicious.<br /><br />I have only one gripe. The method for making sushi rice with a pan. Skip it. Just bring the water to a boil and then turn it down to medium low and watch it. I am looking for brown rice to use for this(I know its supposed to be a no-no but they had to use something like it when they first started making sushi- white rice being a recent thing) but can't find any fat rice.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy. it takes a little getting used to and yes.. buy more Nori sheets. It runs out quick.
2042,B000H241DS,2,1293494400,"Whatever you do, don't follow their instructions for steaming rice. You will end up with a burnt pot of crap.  Secondly, there isn't enough rice in the package for a second try.  Go buy some short grain rice and follow the package instructions for cooking/steaming rice. Then go back to the Sushi Chef instructions for cooling/seasoning the rice. Good thing I spent all that time preparing ingredients for making sushi while the rice was burning. Now I have to go out for more rice."
2043,B000H241DS,5,1234656000,i purchased this set as a gift for someone with little sushi making experience. i did read the product description but was still surprised by how many items came in the package. it came with everything you need minus the fresh fish and veggies. it was put to use at our superbowl party and there was plenty sushi to go around. i was very impressed and the recipient loved it. i would recommend it and would buy it again. sushi chef is awesome.
2044,B000H241DS,4,1311120000,"Despite my niece telling me that what we make with this kit would ""never taste like restaurant sushi,"" we had tremendous fun and made some absolutely delicious California rolls, according to my whole family!  Sushi-making is not for the faint of heart...or those who have a short attention span....as it takes some reading and study to make the rice (cook over this heat, lower to this heat, let sit for xxx minutes, cool quickly by fanning for xx minutes, etc.) properly.  It is also labor-intensive to prepare all the fillings if you want a variety of rolls (we had shrimp, lobster product, crab product, salmon, and even homemade chicken salad).  But in the long run, we had such fun and were so proud of the finished rolls displayed on the plates with the side of ginger that it was most definitely worth it.<br /><br />One tip: make sure you have a really, really sharp knife, and that you clean it with a wet cloth between slices--you'll be glad you did!<br /><br />I have some criticism of the book which could be more organized, explain steps much better, and, in fact, it would be wonderful if the kit included a CD of how to make the different types of sushi, since it is somewhat complicated.  For this reasonm, I would definitely recommend that a beginner find a video on YouTube that shows how the make sushi--very helpful.<br /><br />One other criticism is that I think the kit should include more than just 10 sheets of nori.  Half the bag of sushi rice was just about right for making 10 california rolls, so now I have another half bag rice left (and of course plenty of ginger and the condiments)."
2045,B000H241DS,5,1278374400,"I've never made sushi before, but I've always loved it and really wanted to give it a go. After purchasing this item, my wife and I put on a little get together with a bunch of our friends. The hardest part is making the rice which took a little over 2 hours to be ready. Making the rolls turned out to be a lot easier then anticipated, though you definitely want to try and cover your bamboo roller in clear wrap or something similar to avoid complications. The little book that came along with the set does explain quite a bit of what you'll want to do when preparing your ingredients and how to pay attention to detail. I actually went on Youtube and they have some videos showing you how to make the same rolls from the Sushi Chef Kit which was a real life saver. Everything turned out great and our guest's left happy."
2046,B000H241DS,5,1251849600,"I bought this at a reduced price because I have always wanted to make sushi the right way yet never got around to getting a kit. Everything is included in this (except the main ingredients of course) and it is easy to get started. Although the book may be hard to follow in some places, it is overall a good guide. The included ingredients (rice, soy sauce, ginger, etc.) are all top quality though I would have preferred something a bit more natural. When these run out I will try looking elsewhere for the same quality but maybe also organic. A really great gift for someone who loves sushi but hasn't made any themselves."
2047,B000H241DS,5,1245283200,"Everything's in the box, including a brief sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are difficult to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be better, but for $23.00 on the Amazon Gold Box email this represents excellent value for everything that's included.<br /><br />We bought a separate sushi book which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're happily getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure this in no way prepares you to become a professional sushi chef, but there's definitely some satisfaction in preparing this type of cuisine if you've never made it before."
2048,B000H241DS,2,1326326400,didn't live up to my expectation.as others have said can go and purchase same items at a cheaper price.very disappointed
2049,B000H241DS,5,1323907200,"Bought this over a year ago and we love using this, especially to host sushi making parties. It is a lot of fun to have people over and use this kit, plus fresh ingredients from the market to create our own home-made sushi creations. This also makes a great gift for any fan of sushi, even if they are at best an amateur cook."
2050,B000H241DS,5,1252368000,"I have been buying sushi fixings for several years, and this kit gives you everything you need at a terrific price.  If you're planning a sushi dinner party, this kit is just as good as the items in your your local Japanese store (and at a very comparable price)."
2051,B000H241DS,1,1325548800,I recieved this product as a gift for a friend.  When he opened it we found that there was mold present.  Not a fan and very disappointing.
2052,B000H241DS,5,1238025600,"This product was very fun & easy to use. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it. The first time he made the rice, it came out perfectly. The directions are very clear and everything included is useful. Just make sure you have a very sharp knife!"
2053,B000H241DS,5,1236816000,This was a gift for my daughter on her birthday.  We all loved it and enjoyed how well the sushi turned out.
2054,B000H241DS,5,1348617600,I love experimenting and sushi was the next on my list.. This product made it so easy! I would definitely recommend this Sushi Kit to my family and friends.
2055,B000H241DS,5,1348272000,"This is the set that got us started on our own sushi roll making adventures!  I love having the package together to get me started, as the oriental grocery stores in the nearby city can be a little daunting.  Buy this to begin your sushi making along with this book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764544659"">Sushi For Dummies</a>.  You'll probably want the physical book because you'll want to have it on hand when actually ROLLING the sushi and your fingers will be so dirty, you won't want to mess up your kindle."
2056,B000H241DS,4,1346889600,Nice kit with everything you need to start making sushi except the veggies and fish.  Of course you could just go out and buy all of this at the store.  No issues with freshness of the products.
2057,B000H241DS,5,1345075200,"we have had a few small ""sushi-making"" parties at the house since getting this kit and have really enjoyed it. the kids even like it because we can make them rolls with what they like inside. we have a kid who doesnt eat seafood but really likes a roll with deli roast beef, a scallion and some sharp cheddar. we roll it with rice and he dunks it in a little worcestershire sauce.<br />i definitely recommend this kit. great starter set..."
2058,B000H241DS,5,1344470400,"Excellent product, detailed instructions on how to prepare the rice. Has a few recipes for rolls, would have liked a few more, but that's what the internet is for. Was very nice having everything right out of the box. I would suggest using a zip-lock bag or plastic wrap for the rolling mat if you wish to preserve it for future use. The sushi I made turned out pretty amazing, all on my first try.<br /><br />I would suggest this product to anyone who is interested in this hobby."
2059,B000H241DS,4,1343606400,Bought as a gift for my mom. She loves it  and brings it over whenever we do sushi even though we have our own set.
2060,B000H241DS,3,1341187200,"This had everything in it that we needed to make our own sushi rolls, but the quality of the food inside the kit (rice, ginger, wasabi, and seaweed) was pretty poor.  The tools in it (rolling mat and spoon) and we enjoyed it.  Wouldn't buy a second kit, but the first one was worth it."
2061,B000H241DS,4,1338249600,"I purchased this as part of an anniversary gift for my husband. We haven't used it yet, but he was very excited to receive it and can't wait to use it! It was also delivered very quickly!"
2062,B000H241DS,3,1337040000,"This is a pretty basic kit, and fine for beginners, but the items aren't the best quality. Personally, I'd opt for something better at the same price from sushinut which is where I get my sushi grade fish anyway. Sushi kits are always better when some thought was put into it, this is just one brand's stuff, for better or worse, but I'd opt for better quality for myself and my friends."
2063,B000H241DS,5,1330992000,"Birthday presents for a 13 year old girl can be difficult.  You can't buy them clothes, because they will probably hate them, the gadget they do want is way too expensive, and cash is just not personal enough.  This gift was a life saver!  For less than $50.00, it was a personal, ""cool"" gift that everyone was ecstatic about!  Thank you Amazon for suggesting this!  We love it :)"
2064,B000H241DS,4,1330214400,"Great place for beginners to start. Has all the necessities. And great quality. Not flimsy like other kits out there, longer lasting products."
2065,B000H241DS,5,1328918400,"I love Sushi and especially california rolls. Everytime I buy it,<br />I get upset for paying so much for it. So I decided, thats it time I try preparing it. Guess what?I enjoy making it! This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need to learn how to prepare it. If you master the rice preparation, then you got it made. I love the<br />little cook book. Its more like a instruction booklet. Its great.<br />Thats all you need really. I have made the california rolls two<br />weekends in a row. I will go on to sushi making, once I master this. I still need practice in rolling it, using the mat that came with the kit.<br />I highly recommend this Kit to those who are just beginning to learn how to prepare it. You will spend more, if you go looking for all the ingredients. This Kit has it all!!!And Guess what?Its sooooo much cheaper than in the restaurant!!"
2066,B000H241DS,5,1327017600,My daughter love's Sushi and menitoned she would like a kit for Christmas so she could make her own at home when the urge for Sushi struck her.  I reviewed many online and thougt this was one that would be good for a beginner.  She was thrilled and has since made some beautiful Sushi with the kit.  This was a great value.
2067,B000H241DS,4,1326412800,"I bought this product for a friend, he loved it!!  He couldn't wait to make some sushi over the holidays!  Great product!"
2068,B000H241DS,4,1326067200,"This was a xmas gift for a cook that recently started enjoying sushi. Like the description says, it does contain everything needed to get started. The book is a bit small, but not bad.<br /><br />It's an impressive box, she thought I spent at least $75 on the kit.<br /><br />Only thing that would have been nice is real wasabi, but it's understandable as it doesn't have a long shelf life.<br /><br />I complemented the kit with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/962593460X"">Sushi (Essential Kitchen Series)</a> which was great and I definitely recommend."
2069,B000H241DS,5,1326067200,"Bought as a gift for a sushi lover, it was perfect. Not only does it come with everything but fish but the recipe book is great. It explains the history along with amazing recipes. It is a great value for the price, would buy it again any day."
2070,B000H241DS,4,1325808000,bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! i read the reviews before hand and yes we agree the cookbook wasn't that great but everything else was!
2071,B000H241DS,5,1325635200,"Got this as a gift for my daughter and she was so thrilled to get it. It seems to have everything except the fresh ingredients to make sushi. The recipe book was good, I think once she gets the hang of making the rolls she'll need a better cookbook, but I think it was good for the beginner."
2072,B000H241DS,5,1325462400,This has everything one needs to make their own sushi.  It is a wonderful kit and contains everything from a roll mat to wasabi paste.  I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to make their own sushi!
2073,B000H241DS,4,1325289600,"I received this kit for christmas and we just made the sushi tonight and it was fun kit to make simple sushi.  The book could be better, had a watch a few videos on the net to see how to do actually roll the sushi.  You need access to a good asia market to get some of the ingredients, but one you get the correct ingredients you will have some fun making sushi!"
2074,B000H241DS,5,1325030400,"I love sushi n thought it would be fun to start making it on my own. I looked @ all the other options that specifically came w/ the traditional bamboo roller, n I finally decided to go w/ this one. The packaging is nice n it has everything I need. The recipe book isn't exactly well rounded n has only a few recipes like the California roll, but I was willing to look past it considering there's so many resources out there where I can get what I'm looking for. I recommend this to anyone who's looking to start making sushi in a traditional way."
2075,B000H241DS,4,1324857600,"This kit was great! The cookbook was very helpful and had great sushi ideas. The items were high quality, I just wish there were more of them. I would recommend it for all who love sushi."
2076,B000H241DS,5,1324080000,"I bought this kit as a gift for my boyfriend and I'm very pleased. It looks like great quality, worth the price. It's a really unique gift idea. Also, amazon shipped to me in 48 hours, which was an easy transaction."

2078,B000H241DS,4,1323302400,"Great starter kit for beginners. Could've easily had bought higher quality ingredients and tools on my own for less than what the kit costs. The ingredients seem low quality, But it's ok for someone like me who is learning and just starting to make sushi. This kit could be better though."
2079,B000H241DS,5,1314576000,"I haven't had a chance to use the kit yet since it was a gift for my boyfriend, but the kit was the best deal for everything included. Well worth the purchase and my boyfriend thought it was awesome!"
2080,B000H241DS,5,1313020800,"This kit really does include everything you need to go from never making sushi to being confident.<br /><br />The book, along with a few youtube videos, are the only training I got in how to make sushi and it has been an enjoyable process.  We have used all the ingredients by now, but still use the mat, spoon and book to refer back to from time to time.<br /><br />Great set"
2081,B000H241DS,5,1310256000,"Everything you need, except the fresh meat and veg. is included in this kit.  The instruction booklet is helpful,although scantily illustrated.  The ingredients included are of high quality...and the price is right."
2082,B000H241DS,5,1309392000,Got this for my husband's birthday. He loved it. We only used it once but excited to use it more often.
2083,B000H241DS,5,1304553600,This was my first time making sushi. I really like this product it came with every thing I needed to make it.Great tasting stuff.I will need more pratice rolling the sushi but every thing that came with the kit was great.I would reccommend this to every one.
2084,B000H241DS,5,1303171200,"My husband and I had a wonderful day of eating.  First a soup, then after much anticipation California rolls, smoked salmon rolls and shrimp rolls, which ended with a small bowl of mixed fruit.  The Sushi Chef came with everything and the directions were easy to follow.<br /><br />I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  So much so, my friends and I are planning a sushi party."
2085,B000H241DS,5,1301788800,"This kit is GREAT - all you need to learn how to make sushi (although I did find some good clips on youtube on how to make the rolls) - the rice takes ages to make, you have to wash it three times, cook it, then let it cool (fan it perhaps), then add the rice vinegar or whatever you have to add to it - and it is TOTALLY yummy - and all the other items are great. We used shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese for our first rolls and they were restaurant quality taste due to the good ingredients (although the rolls themselves needed a little extra help to look perfect, but what can you expect, first time round) -  this is a really great kit.  Used up all the nori last night, and will get some more, but this really is all you need to get started.  Couldn't be happier and have recommended it to friends."
2086,B000H241DS,4,1301356800,Everything you need to get started. You can feel and taste the quality. My only concern is the sushi roll mat. The string seems to be wearing/threading out. I don't expect it to last long.
2087,B000H241DS,4,1301270400,"It has everything you need for trying your hand at sushi. It helps to have a nice sharp knife. We didn't have a very good sushi knife so it kind of shredded the roll. The seasoned sushi vinegar is great. Now that I have run out, I have to make some seasoned vinegar, which isn't too hard... But it was nice to have it in the one bottle. The nori sheets included don't taste that great, but they are alright to work with. The ""recipe book"" doesn't have a lot of recipes, so I'd recommend looking up your own recipes, or get creative!"
2088,B000H241DS,4,1300060800,"This kit has everything you need to create your own sushi.  This was our (my husband and I) first attempt.  As long as you allow plenty of time and have plenty of patience, you will have restaurant quality sushi in your own home.  The directions are kind of tricky (which is why I gave 4 starts instead of 5) but you can pretty much get the idea.  Preparing the rice is the hardest part only because it takes about 1.5-2 hours.  I found it easier to work as a team.  I prepared the rice and toasted the nori while my husband cut up the fillers and rolled.  Overall, this is a great way to learning how to make your own sushi.  You have plenty ingredients to use this kit more than once.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try to make their own sushi."
2089,B000H241DS,4,1299110400,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend's parents last year. I included it with some miso soup packages, sesame seeds and a sushi plate set. I really like that it has the bamboo roller as I did a lot of research before making this purchase and read that those are much easier and more efficient for rolling sushi. This package was great and had basically everything, except I wish it included the sesame seeds for what it costs (or used to cost, I see it's about $10 less now). Although it was easy to pick up the seeds at my local grocery store, just an extra trip - which nobody likes.<br /><br />It shipped and arrived very timely and in great condition.<br /><br />I can't review on how well everything works as I haven't heard if they've actually made sushi yet, but it definitely looked nice and was very well received!"
2090,B000H241DS,5,1299024000,I purchased this product so I could learn how to make sushi rolls.  My daughter was very excited about this product when it was delivered and so the sushi making became a family event.  We had a blast.
2091,B000H241DS,5,1298505600,This sushi making kit was really fun.  The instructions were just fine and everything we needed (minus the fresh ingredients) were in the box.  The only thing that would have made the kit better would have been an instructional DVD.  The booklet gets kinda messy when you've got sticky rice all over your hands as you're flipping the pages.  So much fun!  And healthy!
2092,B000H241DS,4,1297296000,"I was very happy when I received this kit. It comes with everything you need to start making sushi and is of very good quality. However, I wish that it would have included more recipes in the booklet and maybe some seasame seeds to go with it. (I can't find seasame seeds anywhere around these parts!) Overall, very pleased with this product."
2093,B000H241DS,4,1296518400,"The kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit. Makes an awesome gift but I reccomend going to a store and purchasing. When it arrived in the mail, the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere... luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so I was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it. We just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag."
2094,B000H241DS,4,1294876800,The kit is complete and fun. The only problem is that the rice bag broke in shipping. The package had another seal though so the rice could be recovered and used.
2095,B000H241DS,5,1294531200,"This Sushi making kit has everything you need if you want to make sushi! And to top that off, it's all great stuff. I got this for my boyfriend and he fell in love with this kit. It's perfect. Definitely a good buy!"
2096,B000H241DS,4,1294444800,"I got this kit for my college son for Christmas as he and his girlfriend enjoy making meals of all kinds together. It was impossible to find a simple kit locally, and I was very happy with this product. It came sooner than promised, and had just about everything to start making sushi. THe only issue was the handbook was not as clear as it could be for a beginner, so they watched some video's on youtube and as a result, we all enjoyed some awesome sushi for New Years. I may order a kit for myself! Thanks"
2097,B000H241DS,5,1294099200,This a great starter kit to get you going. It has all the basic tools and items needed to make basic sushi. Check out you tube to learn how to roll and learn some of the recipes. I recommend for someone who has never made sushi before and wants to try.
2098,B000H241DS,5,1294099200,"My son makes sushi and really wanted a complete set to make sushi for Christmas.  I looked at several and since I don't know anything about making sushi I was a little nervous that I would not get the correct item.  Several of them had plastic parts, etc....however - this one appeared to be good quality so I ordered it.  When he opened this on Christmas morning he could not have been happier. He said ""WOW - this is exactly what I wanted"".....and he was thrilled.  It was a very complete set and nicely packaged."
2099,B000H241DS,5,1294012800,"This sushi making set is a must have for anyone wanting to learn how to make their own sushi. It comes with all the sushi making essentials, even a mini recipe book (as pictured in product details).  If you enjoy inside out sushi, like california rolls, etc; just use a damp cloth to roll the sushi instead of the bamboo mat. This prevents rice from sticking to everything. It is also useful to keep a small bowl of water and vinegar (included in kit) to dip your hands in to remove rice residue on hands while preparing sushi.  I purchased this product from amazon for just under twenty dollars and it has been worth every penny."
2100,B000H241DS,5,1293753600,My husband liked his so much that he bought the same thing for a friend! Delivery was super fast as well!
2101,B000H241DS,5,1293753600,"This item was purchased as a gift for someone who loves the sushi that my wife and I make and I was a little leery at first about a ""kit"" for making sushi.  When it arrived, we were very pleasantly surprised at the quality and completeness of the tools and ingredients.  We were very happy to give this quality gift.  Thank you."
2102,B000H241DS,5,1293667200,"Love this kit!  It includes everything you need to make basic rolls, and the recipe book includes very basic recipes.  I recommend a supplement like Sushi for Dummies if you're into more creative rolls.  Also check out FineCooking.com for a few basic sushi recipes and step-by-step color photos.  The kit includes the bamboo mat, spatula, two kinds of vinegar, 4 cups of raw rice, 5 sheets of nori, pickled ginger, dark soy sauce, and wasabi powder (for making wasabi paste).  You can probably pick all of these things up in the Asian section of your local grocery store, but you'll definitely save money buying the kit.<br /><br />I wish I had bought this years ago - I love sushi and I now love making my own sushi!  It is so much easier than you would think, and so much cheaper than going out for sushi.  One recommendation - wrap your bamboo mat with plastic wrap if you're going to make inside out rolls!"
2103,B000H241DS,4,1293580800,"This sushi making set was purchased as a gift.  Although I did not open it myself, it was complete with almost everything needed to make sushi.  The sushi book lacked a little, but I also purchased another sushi book to accompany this set for the receipent.  All in all, it was a nice set and packaged very well."
2104,B000H241DS,5,1293321600,"I love the kit I can't wait to start experimenting with making sushi! My mother in law got this for me ,a very cool gift!All of the items and spices seem to be good quality stuff too."
2105,B000H241DS,5,1290902400,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my in-laws, it is absolutly wonderful! All that is needed is the fish and or vegetables! I recommend this all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2106,B000H241DS,5,1287619200,I bought this as a birthday gift.  It is perfect and looks great.  I set the shipping for 1-3 day shipping and it was here the next day.  It is a great gift idea or to keep for yourself.
2107,B000H241DS,4,1287273600,"I have to agree with some negative reviewers: the ingredients in the kit could be bought for less if you know what you're looking for.  I was given this as a gift long after I had been making sushi on my own.  It's a well done gift... but I already had all the constituent parts.  I'm going to re-gift it when I find someone curious about making sushi and who needs a head-start.  Like I said, it makes a great gift.  Not so great if you're already into sushi making."
2108,B000H241DS,4,1284681600,"We are reallyt happy with this kit. I purchased an additional sushi book which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're enjoying getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure the professionals do it more efficiently, but there's definitely some fun in preparing this type of cuisine for friends and yourself. Everything's in the box, including a small sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are tricky to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be more extenzive, but for small money, it seems to be a good deal and a lot of fun."
2109,B000H241DS,4,1279324800,"I bought this for the girl in my life.  She really enjoyed experimenting with it.  I also bought her an additional sushi book  a few months before that but it didnt cover the same things as the manual did., which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're happily getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure this in no way prepares you to become a professional sushi chef, but there's definitely some satisfaction in preparing this type of cuisine if you've never made it before. Everything's in the box, including a brief sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are difficult to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be better, but for a few bucks, it is still worth it."
2110,B000H241DS,4,1276041600,This was a second part to a graduation gift. Buying from amazon was a great choice it was cheaper and it arrived faster. Has everything someone needs to make sushi.
2111,B000H241DS,5,1273708800,It was a gift to someone so I haven't used it but it seems like a good kit.  It had a lot of stuff in it and the shipping was fast.
2112,B000H241DS,5,1268611200,"My fiance and I are huge sushi fans, we used to go out to sushi at least twice a week and it began to get costly. We started looking at videos on Youtube to find out  products and tools we would need to buy to make our own sushi at home. After compiling the list, I started researching sushi kits.<br />This sushi kit was the most complete kit on the internet, and the price was also the lowest. It includes everything you need to start making basic sushi at home. The only thing you really need to buy is a really sharp sushi knife. The book is really vague and doesn't have many recipes, we just used it to make sushi rice and used Youtube for sushi recipes and rolling techniques. I would definitely recommend this kit to any beginner- you won't be disappointed!!!"
2113,B000H241DS,5,1267660800,I got this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it! It's a great way to learn how to make sushi and it gives you all the tools you need!
2114,B000H241DS,5,1264809600,"This is a great sushi making kit.  It has everything you need.  If you are just getting into making your own sushi, then this is the perfect kit to get you going!"
2115,B000H241DS,5,1261094400,"excellent sushi making kit , i was able to make for a few people. i love it."
2116,B000H241DS,4,1173312000,"This kit was amazing. It's been so nice to be able to make sushi whenever I'm craving it. The recipe book is easy to follow, and the kit provides all the things you need to make the sushi, including the seaweed.<br /><br />If you like sushi, you will love this sushi making kit."
2117,B000H241DS,4,1327190400,Unable to review.  Purchased & gave as a gift.  The recipients seemed to like it. I have not been in contact with them since then to know if they have had a chance to try it out.
2118,B000NIFO96,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
2119,B000NIFO96,5,1252022400,"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
2120,B000NIFO96,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
2121,B000NIFO96,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2122,B000NIFO96,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
2123,B000NIFO96,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
2124,B000NIFO96,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
2125,B000NIFO96,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
2126,B000NIFO96,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
2127,B000NIFO96,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
2128,B000NIFO96,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
2129,B000NIFO96,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
2130,B000NIFO96,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
2131,B000NIFO96,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
2132,B000NIFO96,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
2133,B000NIFO96,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
2134,B000NIFO96,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
2135,B000NIFO96,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
2136,B000NIFO96,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
2137,B000NIFO96,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
2138,B000NIFO96,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
2139,B000NIFO96,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
2140,B000NIFO96,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
2141,B000NIFO96,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
2142,B000NIFO96,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
2143,B000NIFO96,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
2144,B000NIFO96,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
2145,B000NIFO96,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
2146,B000NIFO96,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
2147,B000NIFO96,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
2148,B000NIFO96,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
2149,B000NIFO96,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
2150,B000NIFO96,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
2151,B000NIFO96,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
2152,B000NIFO96,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
2153,B000NIFO96,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
2154,B000NIFO96,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
2155,B000NIFO96,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
2156,B000NIFO96,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
2157,B000NIFO96,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
2158,B000NIFO96,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
2159,B000NIFO96,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
2160,B000NIFO96,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
2161,B000NIFO96,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
2162,B000NIFO96,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
2163,B000NIFO96,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
2164,B000NIFO96,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
2165,B000NIFO96,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
2166,B000NIFO96,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
2167,B000NIFO96,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
2168,B000NIFO96,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
2169,B000NIFO96,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
2170,B000NIFO96,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
2171,B000NIFO96,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
2172,B000NIFO96,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
2173,B000NIFO96,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
2174,B000NIFO96,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
2175,B000NIFO96,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
2176,B000NIFO96,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
2177,B000NIFO96,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
2178,B000NIFO96,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
2179,B000NIFO96,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
2180,B000NIFO96,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
2181,B000NIFO96,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
2182,B000NIFO96,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
2183,B000NIFO96,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
2184,B000NIFO96,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
2185,B000NIFO96,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
2186,B000NIFO96,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
2187,B000NIFO96,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
2188,B000NIFO96,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
2189,B000NIFO96,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
2190,B000NIFO96,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
2191,B000NIFO96,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
2192,B000NIFO96,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
2193,B000NIFO96,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
2194,B000NIFO96,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
2195,B000NIFO96,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
2196,B000NIFO96,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
2197,B000NIFO96,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
2198,B000NIFO96,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
2199,B000NIFO96,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
2200,B000NIFO96,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"

It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
2202,B000NIFO96,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
2203,B000NIFO96,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
2204,B000NIFO96,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
2205,B000NIFO96,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
2206,B000NIFO96,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
2207,B000NIFO96,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
2208,B000NIFO96,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
2209,B000NIFO96,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
2210,B000NIFO96,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
2211,B000NIFO96,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
2212,B000NIFO96,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
2213,B000NIFO96,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
2214,B000NIFO96,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
2215,B000NIFO96,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
2216,B000NIFO96,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
2217,B000NIFO96,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
2218,B000NIFO96,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
2219,B000EVMNMI,1,1212364800,"When I bought the small bag in the store, it was great. After I bought the 5lbs bag, not anymore. It is hard and taste like other gummi candies. I felt cheated. I was looking forward to receiving it, now I don't even want to eat it. They must have shipped an old bag to me. Probably won't buy from them again. At least not food."
2220,B000EVMNMI,2,1210550400,this product is like a laxative.  It made me go twice after the first bite
2221,B000EVMNMI,1,1328054400,I love the regular Haribo gummie bears but these taste like artificial green lime. They do make me burp though!
2222,B000EVMNMI,1,1189900800,"Received 5 lb poly bag of cola flavored gummies....very disappointing... they are harder and difficult to chew.  Not like the Haribo Gummi bought at Walgreens in a small package, which were soft and easy to chew.  Are these dried out?  Old stock?"
2223,B000EVMNMI,1,1247184000,"I took a chance on these because of all the positive reviews you find on this product on multiple websites. I ordered a 5lb bag of the Haribo Happy Cola's and I have to say I'm very disappointed. They are extremely chewy.. it's literally like chewing on a dry piece of caulk. No matter how long you chew, it doesn't break down.. it may as well be a piece of rubber. If you suck on them they last for quite some time, obviously, but that cola taste is not there. You get a slight hint of cola when you first pop one in, but after that time passes (5-10 seconds in) you're left with a wet noodle made out of caulk that tastes like corn syrup.<br /><br />There must be a huge group of people who like generic candy out there or a heck of a lot of Haribo workers boosting these reviews. I certainly do not see anything positive what-so-ever to write about this product and I absolutely do not recommend anyone buy these."
2224,B000EVMNMI,1,1212883200,"I bought these cause they were cheap and had lots of good reviews.<br /><br />However, these dont taste like cola... at all.  They taste like some weird combination of ginger root and oranges.  Needless to say, coke is not made out of ginger root and orange peels, so I am disappointed.<br /><br />These are a must buy... if you like the combination of ginger and orange.<br /><br />On a positive note... they were very gummy, almost annoyingly so, but just like the regular bears are."
2225,B000EVMNMI,1,1199404800,I purchased these hoping they would taste as good as some made in indiana.  I was wrong they smell funny and taste even worse.
2226,B000EVMNMI,2,1182124800,These are ok. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste exactly like pepsi cola that's gone flat. They're not terrible but they also aren't that great.
2227,B000EVMNMI,2,1250726400,"after trying different flavors of albaneese gummy bears --- The lemon Albaneese gummy bears have a distinct realistic lemon flavor and is not too sweet--these cola gummies are hard to chew on- the flavor is a slight cola flavor,the degree of sweetness is bland--if you like chewing and biting on a gummy for lenghty time that's somewhat bla this is a description of this product"
2228,B000EVMNMI,1,1187827200,"Then this is the gummy candy just for you. Your kids won't touch it. Don't even offer any to them, they'll just spit the first piece right out.<br />Did someone say these taste like a flat cola? Yeah, a cheap supermarket brand that's been left open on a window sill, in the sun, for two weeks.<br />The Gold Bears are super to leave on a positive note."
2229,B000EVMNMI,4,1226966400,"So here's how it went down.<br /><br />My teenage sons crowd around with innocent curiosity as I take the mammoth 5-pound bag out of the cardboard box, the box with the beguiling Amazon smile on the side. That knowing, wicked Cheshire grin. Within seconds the bag is neatly cut open. An oddly hypnotic aroma wafts out.<br /><br />It begins.<br /><br />We all sample one or two of the pleasantly rubbery candies, but find ourselves exchanging the same puzzled expression: that flavor---not really cola...vaguely medicinal, yet not offensive. Hmm. Further testing is required.<br /><br />We all sit down. Sampling continues now in earnest---they're so small! Where's the harm?---and we agree that you need to eat quite a few to identify the flavor with any accuracy. Not a name brand cola, to be sure...one of those ""store brands,"" after it's gone flat. We notice that after the first 50 or so, the flavor seems to change somewhat, perhaps because all our teeth are now caked with adherent masses of gummy residue. Our mood is high, so testing continues.<br /><br />General consensus is reached after the first pound or two that the bottles in the middle of the mass are softer and more fragrant than the stuff from the top of the bag. The bag is passed around, sniffing ensues. Great effort is expended seeing how far a bottle can be stretched, while held between the front teeth, until it breaks.<br /><br />The unmistakable signs of hyperglycemia ---exhilaration, rapid speech, a cola-like aroma on the breath---go somewhat unnoticed as we burrow deeper into the jiggly wad of gummies. Dinner is postponed along with homework. A telephone call from my ex-wife goes unanswered. The scientific process cannot be interrupted. Would Fermi have taken time out from inventing the x-ray deathgun to take a call from his ex-wife? Please.<br /><br />The fun almost stops when a bottle goes up a nostril ---kids!--- but everything is soon back on track when we discover that moistened bottles can be stuck to the forehead for minutes at a time. Soon my sons' faces bristle with the things. A joke is made about ""edible lesions"". Hilarity ensues. Photos are taken. Outside it grows dark while leaves blow about, unraked. The scratching of a pet at the door stopped some time ago.<br /><br />Bottles are eaten ten at a time now. Cola-stained spittle dribbles down a chin. No time to wipe. Got to keep chewing. They are SO VERY SMALL.<br /><br />Suddenly the bag is empty.<br /><br />Empty. The room goes quiet.  The box is re-examined, but no stray gummies are found. The box with the grin. That damn, mocking grin. I have to explain to the children why I only ordered one 5-pound bag. We all feel somewhat sick. We are all trembling now.<br /><br />Parents, sometimes single dads cannot be trusted to make good judgments about their kids' eating habits. Living with the stress of alimony can pervert that part of the mind which regulates dietary choices, or common sense.<br /><br />I hope this will serve as a valuable object lesson for you all."
2230,B000EVMNMI,5,1204243200,"First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true! If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know, and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Super Cola Bottles, are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in a delicious cola flavor and they are huge pieces of candy!  These are not small like the bears, at all. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh,delicious and full of flavor.  To keep<br />them this way, I put them into two different ""freezer type bags"" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact cola bottles that you get there, without the worry that everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi super cola bottles, they are a sweet<br />and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more super cola bottles, plus a few different kinds of other gummis as well.  Simply because, we all have our favorites!"

2232,B000EVMNMI,5,1194825600,"You know after reading the other review I was shocked to say the least of their disatisfaction.  As a child my father was in the Air Force and we lived on base in Germany and we would visit the ""Gummi Store"" as I called it - my sisters and brother giggle at me as I was 5 years old and trecking to get to the gummi store was through a forest as I believed to get our Haribo candy - that forest as I know now, is a park.  The store was real and so was the candy and to this day - every holiday we always gift the family and friends with Haribo.<br /><br />I gave up soda long ago but love the taste of the Happy Cola - you have to watch as Haribo sells two different kinds - Happy Cola are the little ones and the one you really want. The other ones ""Coke Bottles"" think they are called are HUGE and who wants to eat something that big - Happy Cola is about the size of your pinky (finger).<br /><br />Above and beyond the Happy Cola is the Haribo Gold Bears and they are by far my favorite and coming in second the Happy Cola.<br /><br />Try it yourself and you will love it - get a small bag if you want to try it out first instead of getting the 5 pound bag - Rite Aid sells the small bag for a little more than a dollar I think - I do not tend to look at the price but the quality of the product.  We have never had a problem due to freshness etc.  I do not work for Haribo nor am I affiliated with any retail environment but a stay at home Mom who knows her german candy.<br /><br />Enjoy."
2233,B000EVMNMI,3,1331683200,"I am a long time Haribo fan. I was first introduced to Haribo gummies when I moved to Germany in 1979. The Happy-Cola gummies are my all time favorite, so I have really enjoyed ordering them in the 5-pound bags over the past year.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor of the gummies varies depending on where they are made.  When I first started ordering them on Amazon's Subscribe & Save, the Haribo Happy-Cola gummies were made in Spain and they had the flavor and texture of the original Harbio gummies available in Germany (5 stars). However, the bag I received in my most recent shipment shows that they were made in Turkey.....and the flavor and texture are both lacking (2 stars), likely due to the quality of ingredients used.<br /><br />So it saddens me to cancel my future Subscribe and Save orders of the Haribo Happy-Cola gummies. I wish there was a way to know the country of origin but it varies depending from which supplier Amazon is sourcing the product. :("
2234,B000EVMNMI,5,1203897600,"Haribo gummis are the only brand to eat.  These are my favorites.  They even smell fantastic.  Texture is great.  I like to put them in the fridge and eat them cold.  For some reason I think it enhances the flavor.  Can't go wrong with these but beware, as they are highly addictive!"
2235,B000EVMNMI,5,1167696000,"Even with the title, I love these!  They are very hard to find where I live, well that's not entirely true.  The candy store at the mall 2 blocks from me has them, but they are EXPENSIVE, I believe $7.50 a pound!  Mind you, they are the exact same brand as these ones, I suck at math (blame the California public school system...)  but these are a outstanding deal, even with shipping it's much cheaper.<br /><br />Do I need a 5lb bag? probably not, could I eat a 5 pound bag by myself? Most definitely, not in 1 sitting, or even 1 day, but I'll manage :)<br /><br />These are not too sweet, and they have a strangely addicting Coke like taste, and the clear top parts, almost remind me of a 7-up'ish flavor.  These are really delicious, I might have to order a bag every month so I can eat a big handful every day, wonder how long they'll stay fresh when properly stored :)"
2236,B000EVMNMI,4,1219017600,Be wary of when you order these candies as they do not keep well in the heat.  I found when amazon sent the gummies packed in a box within a box they made it fine.  However those not within the second box was a melted mess.
2237,B000EVMNMI,5,1175472000,"Warning though, not figure friendly, because once you get them it's hard to quit!<br /><br />My order came quickly and very fresh vs the overpriced candy stores where they're in a bin and you don't know how long they've been sitting there, or spending almost $2 for 5 ounces. Great deal right now, and with 2 bags, you get free shipping!"
2238,B000EVMNMI,5,1163376000,"My parents were in the US military and we were stationed in (formerly West) Germany. I spent many years of my early and happy childhood there. Upon returing to the US in the 1970s, one of the many things I missed about Germany was the fantastic German candies. I was able to find the Haribo Bears in the mid-1980s and the Cola bottle in the late 1980s.<br /><br />The Haribo products are much better than their American imitiations. The Haribo products tend to be a bit firmer and of more uniform consistency. The American imitations are way too soft and too sweet. The Haribo products have a better, finer and more complex flavor. The 5 pound bags are an excellent deal!"
2239,B000EVMNMI,3,1329523200,"The taste of a Haribo Happy Cola Gummy is quite honestly a miracle. I still have no idea how they're able to take such an intense amount of cola flavor and pack it into a teeny-weeny piece of chewy deliciousness. It's downright succulent! If I had a five pound bag on me at this very moment, I'd down them all in an instant...but not before I pinched my nose with a clothes pin.<br /><br />These things reek. Every bag I've ever bought knocks me on my haunches and I've come to accept the bad odor as a bit of extra baggage. Sometimes they smell like poop, sometimes they smell like vomit, but they always smell wretched whatever the case. Not only do I avoid sticking my nose anywhere near the bag, but I have to wash my hands as soon as I'm finished snacking! It's sick!<br /><br />If the smell which emanated from these little guys was that of a freshly cracked can of soda pop, five stars would be issued all around. But it's not. It's the same stench that I wake up to after a hard night on the town.<br /><br />Once again, the taste is great. I still eat them after all, so I can't knock 'em completely. Buying a bag wouldn't be a mistake, but opening the bag in a small, draft free room would be."
2240,B000EVMNMI,3,1296864000,"I bought this candy because of 20% curiosity 80% that one reviewer's spectacularly written story.  The flavor of this candy can be pretty much summed up like this: without the fizz cola flavor is mostly sugar.  I didn't really realize this until I bought the candy. It had the flavor of flat cola, and the flavor is faint (otherwise it would probably be too sweet).  Was also a tad on the rubbery side for my tastes.  Between me, my two college roomates, and two other friends we BARELY managed to polish this thing off before we got too sick of them. 5 lbs is a lot of candy, even for five college guys."
2241,B000EVMNMI,5,1206835200,This is my husband's most favorite candy.  He was very excited to find it here and separated the 5 pound bag into smaller portion ziplock bags to satisfy his sweet tooth.
2242,B000EVMNMI,5,1198713600,"After searching several stores and websites, I finally found them here.  They arrived fast and FRESH.  Once opeing, I obviously put them into a ziplock bag to maintain the freshness.  My 3 kids absolutely loved them, and of course so did I.  I'm back ordering more."
2243,B000EVMNMI,5,1197158400,"These gummies were great. Not too sweet with a nice, firm texture. I will definitely be ordering more!"
2244,B000EVMNMI,5,1173225600,i have ordered these twice and both times they were fresh and yummy thanks
2245,B000EVMNMI,5,1152576000,These have great flavor.  They are very fresh.  Great buy - good quality
2246,B000EVMNMI,5,1167955200,"I was so excited when I found these on Amazon!  These are my favorite candy and it has been nearly impossible to find them anywhere (at least this brand, which are so much better than any others).  I was a little leery about buying 5 pounds at a clip, but let me tell you, they have gone faster than I expected.  It's almost time to buy a new bag!"
2247,B000EVMNMI,5,1172620800,"I find it ironic after reading this that someone mentioned air force and Germany.  As, growing up that is where we got used to the greatness of German candy.  If you believe America was the king then you missing out.  Most fond memory was in Germany going down to the lake with my german coinage.  Was a small little shop there and would get 3 different types of gummies(twin-cherries,frogs,and cola bottles).  Hardest thing to find and now and if you do find its alot for just small portions.  If I had the money I would buy 20 of these.  Hope everyone who gets them enjoy them and maybe remember great memories!"
2248,B000EVMNMI,5,1168473600,"I love Haribo, and this is one of the best gummy, I had to hide it from my nephew and niece for a few days before they started to beg me for it =P"
2249,B000EVMNMI,5,1163721600,"My Father who was in the military was stationed in GERMANY with the airforce - as children we loved German candy and grew to have a fondness for it that you just cannot get anywhere else.  My memories of eating Gummy Bears, coca bottles etc., were to me walking through the forest to get to the gummi store as we called it - that huge forest to me was a walk through a park with trees as my mother still laughs at me today over - but I remember the walk to this day! That huge forest! I am purchasing these items for my sisters who will smile and think about our childhood as well - Being in the military is hard enough for families today but their is always something that may bring a smile to someone with a happy memory! keep smiling and we love Haribo!.  Thank you AMAZON.COM for those Forest memories of the Gummi Store in Germany!"
2250,B000EVMNMI,3,1349136000,They don't taste quite the same since they moved from the original country of orgin.  Still very very good but the ones that were from up north were better. (sorry turkey)<br /><br />And as long as Amazon is going to use names this is my last review and most likely purchase..<br /><br />Still a good candy though.
2251,B000EVMNMI,5,1348444800,"Just what you would expect, yummy gummy cola! Be sure to open the bag with greater care than I did as you will want to reseal it, unless you are eating them all at once:)"
2252,B000EVMNMI,5,1348185600,"this is a fantastic candy that everyone should try. If you like soda and gummies you have to try these. They may sound weird or gross at first, but everyone that I have shared these with have loved them."
2253,B000EVMNMI,5,1347580800,Imagine you are in a snow globe.  But it's filled with gummi sodas.  Now imagine you open your mouth and stick your head back..... for eight straight hours.  Awwww yeah......
2254,B000EVMNMI,4,1343606400,"I ordered these cola gummies to keep my addiction going but failed to remember that Atlanta heat (100 degrees) plus sitting at my front door equals one giant block of gummies.  Yes, all 5 pounds had melted into a solid block of gummy.  I have since used kitchen scissors to cut of pieces when I need a fix.  I will remember to order this next time during the winter months."
2255,B000EVMNMI,2,1342051200,Will not buy again. The flavor was not what I would call cola. they really didn't smell like any cola I have smelled. Sure won`t buy again. Really was disappointed.

A German<br />company founded in the 1920's by HANS RIEGAL Sr. They<br />made the 1st gummie ever in 1922.<br /><br />They have been accused of using JEWISH forced labor during<br />the war................they deny it.<br /><br />THEY ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CANDY COMPANIES THE<br />WORLD !<br /><br />Slogan--HARIBO MAKES PEOPLE HAPPY !<br /><br />They make gummies,jelly sweets and liquorice.<br /><br />The Cola gummi--OK but not great.

I L O V E their GOLDEN BEAR  gummies the best.<br /><br />A good price and they ship quickly.Many Haribo items are<br />available for subscribe and save.<br /><br />bbp okc ok 63 retired"
2258,B000EVMNMI,5,1339545600,"Always fresh and tasty, love em !!!! These take me back to my youth when I tasted these bottles for the first time ..... Get em now !!! You won't regret it !!!"
2259,B000EVMNMI,5,1338940800,Been buying Haribo products for 40 years.  Noticed they even are starting to put some sugar back into  their products. Tasty as usual.
2260,B000EVMNMI,5,1334620800,"I purchased these to put in my work center for people to snack on.<br /><br />Strangely some people didn't like the (cola) taste as they kept eating them.<br /><br />All in all, the bag was gone in a day.<br /><br />For the curious, I would say the cola flavor is in line with Sames Choice cola."
2261,B000EVMNMI,4,1328832000,it took a bit longer than i expected to get it in but it was certainly worth it.  they are chewy just enough.  and this really is quite a bit of gummy colas.  they would have lasted longer buy my sister got ahold of the bag and ate half in one sitting lol!  they are that good.
2262,B000EVMNMI,2,1326931200,My son has accepted these gummies immediately. Their chewable form and the cola flavor are pleasant and they complete his diet so well. Besides his attention has improved and he is calmer.
2263,B000EVMNMI,5,1326758400,"I have been eating Haribo Happy Cola for a while now, on a weekly basis.  This has become a regular staple food at my groups weekly D&D sessions alongside the normal cheetos and mountain dew, so when I saw that there was a 5 lb. bag option available, I jumped on it.  I know I won't be disappointed in the product because I eat them out of the small bags already.  Highly recommended, but remember, in moderation.  I don't recommend eating an entire 5 lb. bag in one sitting."
2264,B000EVMNMI,5,1324944000,I buy these for my son every year for Christmas and they are all gone by New Years.  he would be crushed if I missed a year.
2265,B000EVMNMI,5,1322179200,"These are pretty consistent with what you get in the smaller Haribo bags at your grocery store. They're a bit tougher/stiffer than some other gummies (I think Haribo tends to be), but they are awesome."
2266,B000EVMNMI,5,1319932800,What can I say HARIBO CANDY is great. The product was very fresh and tasty.<br /><br />yummy yummy<br /><br />Amazon also delivered the bag in great time.<br /><br />Ate the whole bag in 3 weeks (my dentist is not going to be pleased with that)<br /><br />Yummy
2267,B000EVMNMI,5,1318896000,"You can resist these unbelievable treats. They come in a nondescript amazon box, packaged in a hermetically sealed plastic bag. This is our second or third batch, all have arrived promptly and in fresh condition."
2268,B000EVMNMI,5,1317254400,I love it so much that I have it delivered every month.  I wish it contains more cola favor if Haribo wants to improve on the already perfect cola candy.  Price is great here at Amazon and I save a lot from going to Target and get their tiny little bags for $2 each.  Will see what my dentist say in 2 months...
2269,B000EVMNMI,5,1315699200,"It's 5 lbs of yummy gumminess, what more do I need to say?  Let me just tell you this, five POUNDS is A L O T of gummies.  Not for the feint of heart or someone with no self control.  Don't take the whole bag in bed w/ you for movie night ;)"
2270,B000EVMNMI,5,1314748800,"One of my favorite snacky indulgences, and now my kids are hooked, too.  Not too sweet, and the tangy flavor is fabulous.  Now if only I could stop eating them by the handful..."
2271,B000EVMNMI,5,1313366400,"How could you go wrong with a 5 pound bag o candy? Ridiculously low price, considering its a five pound bag, and one of my favorite candies out there! Shipping prices were reasonable, and it arrived a lot faster then estimated (3 days after I ordered the product, it was sitting at my doorstep). Also, if you are trying the product for the first time, definitely do not get a five pounder, because if you buy it, and don't like it, you're stuck with five pounds of candy. But if you do happen to like the candy, then buy the five pound bag, its definitely worth it, and better then buying a bunch of those tiny one dollar bags at your local drugstore or candy selling store."
2272,B000EVMNMI,5,1312588800,I bought these just as a joke since I work on an island and couldn't get Coca Cola for a few months due to budget cutbacks and I shared these and now I only have 1 lb. left after sharing.<br /><br />Everyone loved them and couldn't stop eating them at the movie night and appreciation party.<br /><br />5lbs seems like alot but it wasn't i had to hide the bag so I can keep some for me :)<br /><br />Packaging well protected as always from Amazon.com
2273,B000EVMNMI,4,1310947200,Very delicious! The consistency of the cola gummi candy was more like concentrated than those of the gummi bears. It was not as soft but the flavors linger longer in the mouth. Love it and will order more in the future
2274,B000EVMNMI,5,1310256000,"I bought several bags of these... filled them in a giant jar, and my roommates and friends went through 25 pounds in a month.  Yes, that's right, in one month.  That's testimony for how amazing and delicious Haribo can make gelatin taste...."
2275,B000EVMNMI,5,1308960000,Received product much sooner than expected and was packaged in a sturdy box that accommodated the package size. Very happy with the product  - well packaged. Thank you. Will purchase again soon!!!
2276,B000EVMNMI,4,1307059200,Great Value compared to buying in the store!<br />Only problem I have at times is that sometimes they are really dry and hard. Seems to be a problem resulting from the weather though.<br />Overall still great!
2277,B000EVMNMI,4,1301097600,I like this alot... The only problem is that these are way too big for me. I should of got the regular size ones. These things are about 1 inch and a half at least and thick... But they are still good.
2278,B000EVMNMI,5,1299888000,"I love these delicious chewy gummy colas. I eat a handful of these after my intense workouts because they contain dextrose which has better bioavailabilty to your muscles. Oh yeah , I eat them when I am craving a sweet treat too. My husband and kids love them too. We love all Haribo gummy products because they taste great and they are enjoyable eat."
2279,B000EVMNMI,5,1289433600,I love Haribo Gummy candy and the cola taste is really nice on these!! A great deal buying bulk on Amazon. Love my cola candies! :)
2280,B000EVMNMI,5,1287964800,"These are easily my wife's favorite treat but they are so expensive if you buy them at the candy store at the mall, and I've never been a fan of buying bulk items where masses of people can 'interact' with them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that I found them on Amazon and at 1/3 the cost of buying them at the mall.  In addition to being much cheaper, they are considerably fresher than the ones that come from the bulk containers at the mall.<br /><br />We put ours in a big tupperware container once we open up the bag and they stay fresh for weeks, but they rarely last that long at our house.  Whenever someone opens the container, that yummy smell usually draws everyone else over for a handful or two.  The only time that they last for more than a week or so is if they get pushed to the back of the pantry and are forgotten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I think these are something that you either really like or really don't like.  There is little in-between.  If you're not sure about them, go buy a small handful from the candy store in the mall or even in a little sealed bad at the grocery store.  If you are a fan of these, this is the place to buy them.  If you seal them up well, they'll last quite a while and you'll save yourself quite a bit of money (and a trip to the mall)."
2281,B000EVMNMI,5,1286841600,One thing you will find upon purchasing Haribo products is originality.  They are pioneers in the field of gummy candies. It is important to consider them first when you enjoy gummies.<br />Honestly these gummies are amazing unless you fo not like the flavor. This flavor is not for everyone but if you enjoy them I would recommend purchasing. Make sure you have some sort of container or bag to put them in after you open since they do not come in a resealable bag. The five pounds will last a while depending on how many people are consuming them. Highly recommend to anyone who has not tasted them to try. You will not be disappointed.
2282,B000EVMNMI,5,1278979200,"Bought these as a gift for my son, he just loves the things, they are hard to fine in local stores and often cost alot more than what I paid for them at Amazon."
2283,B000EVMNMI,5,1278374400,"Let me start by saying that I think these candies are excellent.  They have that tough, chewy texture that is neither just soft goo nor the jaw tiring, too hard to get started chewing chewing experience of gum stuck under a desk -- just right for me.  The flavor does not strike me as anything more than vaguely reminiscent of cola-- there is a pronounced aroma of cinnamon when one gets a whiff upon opening the bag and during chewing the taste is a slightly sour/slightly sweet citrus (vaguely lemon) with only infrequent small bursts of a background hint of cola.  I do not care for sour candy, fruit or anything really and normally find those things only palatable when balanced with an overwhelming sweetness much like lemon ade and I try to avoid that kind of sugar blast.  These Haribo Gummi Candy, Happy-Cola are are an effective balance.<br />  Sorry if I sound like some effete gummi bear snob but I was trying to describe a flavor that is not easily described.  The bottom line is that no matter what the flavor is supposed to be, it is very pleasantly infused in a matrix of just the right texture.  I like these a lot and expect to order more."
2284,B000EVMNMI,4,1258243200,"The taste of the cola flavored gummy bears is ok, the regular harbi gummy bears have a much better flavor. I wont be buying these again as they were just too hard and chewy, not anywhere as soft as you get from the local store. If you like your gummy bears chewy these are for you, if you want a soft gummy bear look elsewhere."
2285,B000EVMNMI,5,1255910400,"If you want the best value. This 5 pounder is the way to go.<br /><br /> like their original gummy bears so much that I grab a pack of this to try. Not disappointed at all. You can really taste the cola flavor on this bottle shaped candies. It is not too sticky that it glues your teeth together; although a bit on the rubbery side. Not too sweet neither. Just the right combination of flavors to taste. . From the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (Haribo - based in Germany).<br /><br />Just FYI: 5 oz bag has 3.5 servings, with each serving at 140 calories, 10% carbo, 21g sugar, and 3g of protein. A serving is about 17 pieces of gummies."
2286,B000EVMNMI,5,1248134400,"I used to always eat these as a child and loved them, so I had to treat myself to this when I saw it on Amazon! The 5 lb bag is a great deal for the price and these are so good that it's hard to stop eating them! Someone else mentioned that Haribo has the best gummy candies, and I'd have to agree whole-heartedly. They are gummy but not too hard, and the ""cola"" flavor is perfect. This particular bag would be great for a party or something like that. They are so delicious that it's hard to stop once you start! The bag came in perfect condition, and the gummies tasted fresh. I'm almost finished with the bag, and all in all, I'd buy it again!"
2287,B000EVMNMI,5,1244851200,I can't get enough of Happy-Cola.  The 5 pound bag is a great value.  I have ordered it several times from Amazon and it has always arrived quickly and very fresh - the expiration date is a year out.
2288,B000EVMNMI,5,1239321600,These shipped fast and were fresh and tasty. They last longer if you put them in the fridge and take some out to sit and soften before you eat them.
2289,B000EVMNMI,5,1237334400,"Everytime I order these, my family, friends and coworkers would just eat them up in record time.  Everyone seems to LOVE these gummies; they're almost addictive.  You really can't go wrong here ;-)"
2290,B000EVMNMI,5,1236124800,"I have always loved these things.  When I deployed to Iraq, the PX stocked a variation of these with a slight lemon flavor (like a lemon in your Coke).  Recently, the PX stopped stocking these for some reason.  So one day I was browsing and saw that Amazon sells these in 5 lb. bags!<br /><br />While it is unfortunate that Amazon won't ship grocery goods overseas, I had these sent to my home address, where my wife forwarded them on to me here in Iraq.<br /><br />I munch on these in my down time and am glad I can always get more!<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon!"
2291,B000EVMNMI,5,1231286400,"I got my gummies promptly and I am enjoying every bite of them. The bag was bigger than I thought it would be, but thats a good thing."
2292,B000EVMNMI,4,1229731200,"It was very nice.<br /><br />Package was big, came a day early. Highly recommeneded."
2293,B000EVMNMI,4,1228262400,"Just a note: this is a LOT of candy. If you are ordering this make sure you have a lot of friends and family that will help you finish off the bag.<br /><br />After the first handful (which is excellent, mind you) I was set for a few days. Apparently no one else in the house cares for gummy candy and it took me a few weeks to finish up the candy.<br /><br />Other than that, they taste good (although not entirely like cola) and have a good consistency."
2294,B000EVMNMI,5,1227484800,These are awesome. I love cola bottle gummi candy and Haribo are the best.  These bring back so many fond memories of my childhood.  Mmmm. . . .
2295,B000EVMNMI,5,1226880000,"These are my favorite candy of all time. HOWEVER... a lot of people don't like them. I would strongly recomment finding them locally and trying them first!<br /><br />Also be aware they are a little harder than gummi bears by nature... even at their very freshest. I actually like them better if they've been open for a few days... but I'm just weird that way.<br /><br />After paying just over $2.00 for a 5oz. bag at my local grocery store, I was thrilled to find a good place to buy bulk online.<br /><br />If you know 'em and love 'em don't hesitate to buy. If you don't know them, then try them somewhere first.<br /><br />They also ship very fast."
2296,B000EVMNMI,4,1226793600,"My family was excited to get the 5 pound bag of cola bottles because we go through the little bags quickly.  But, 5 pounds is a lot of gummy cola bottles and we it has taken us months to go through half the bag.  I think the other half will spoil before we can eat them."
2297,B000EVMNMI,5,1225238400,"I order these all the time. Great value bulk price. If you like coke cola, you will love these."
2298,B000EVMNMI,5,1223251200,This is my son's favorite candy.  Thank you for the prompt delivery.  It's exactly what I ordered!
2299,B000EVMNMI,5,1220832000,"I love any gummi products.  This is definitely one of my favorite flavor.  If you haven't tried it, you should."
2300,B000EVMNMI,5,1215388800,"I remember these from my college days. I don't remember how I stumbled onto them on Amazon, but when I did, I bought a bag. They were just like I remembered them-annoyingly addicting! The more you eat, the better they are. They were soft and reasonably fresh, certainly better than in the store, if you can find them.<br />Highly recommended, but not if you are on a diet."
2301,B000EVMNMI,5,1215216000,"I almost ate the whole bag in one sitting.  So good, but I'm sure it's not healthy to eat so many. Be careful and space them out!"
2302,B000EVMNMI,5,1213488000,They where so good i ate them all in less then 24 hours with my other friend.
2303,B000EVMNMI,5,1213315200,"I used to splurge and buy a handful of these gummi treats with my allowance when I was younger. Then, a few years back when traveling in Italy, I found a pack of these at a snack bar in a train station. They have quickly taken over as being my favorite gummi candy. The 5-pound bag is lasting a lot longer than I thought. And I will re-order when I run out!"
2304,B000EVMNMI,5,1212364800,These are the best gummies that I have had in a while.  They were just the way that I liked them... FRESH.  I would get another bag if I could afford the weight gain.
2305,B000EVMNMI,5,1200700800,They are great and were fresh.  It takes a long time to eat 5 pounds of gummies. I also like them cause they are fat free.  If you have never had the gummi cokes... they taste (to me anyway) a lot like that holiday spice pepsi they had a few years ago.
2306,B000EVMNMI,5,1196726400,"I used to get these when I was a kid, and finding them again has been a real treat.  These are sold by about 5 sources on amazon, so prices vary.<br /><br />If you have never eaten these, then go find a 3oz bag somewhere and try them.  They are not for everyone."
2307,B000EVMNMI,5,1194739200,I have ordered these a couple of times and they have been fresh both times.  Delivery is quick also.  No regrets.
2308,B000EVMNMI,5,1189900800,"Shipping was super fast. I got it two days after I bought it. And the candy was great! I enjoyed it, my little sister enjoyed it, and my mom even enjoyed it after she found out that I bought 5lbs of candy. Its been about a  month and I only have a few ounces left. It wouldve been gone sooner if my mom hadnt hid it from me! (I'm 17 by the way)"
2309,B000EVMNMI,5,1184889600,"I love this candy, period! They have a slight coke taste and also the white part taste kinda like sprite, go figure eh?"
2310,B000EVMNMI,5,1179878400,"Wifes loves these.  If we're lucky a 5 lb bag will last a few weeks.  If you haven't tried these, try them....."
2311,B000EVMNMI,5,1178668800,"The Gummi Colas are one of the best gummi candies out there. It was a very good bargain to get a 5-lb bag for such a low price. Being my second favorite gummi candy of all time, I was glad to see it on Amazon and quickly snatched a bag. The delicious flavor of cola is a wonderful sensation in the form of a gummi."
2312,B000EVMNMI,5,1163808000,"This really is a great candy, and very hard to find in stores."
2313,B000EVMNMI,3,1211673600,"I love the cola flavored gummies. LOVE it! but these are a little too hard/stiff for me. VERY chewy, almost a stale type of chewy. wish it was more like the soft gummies that you can get from the grocery stores. but the flavor is good though.  price is great for 5 pounds but it's only getting 3 stars. it would have gotten 5 stars if it was softer."
2314,B000EVMNMI,5,1151625600,"I grew up in Europe, and for me this candy is a classic.  After I moved in the US I only saw this product in small bag, and in few and far between places (and nowhere near I live of course).  So it was great to see Amazon selling it!  I immediately bought 2 bags (to get the free shipping) and enjoying them immensely."
2315,B000EVMNMI,3,1342569600,"Be cautioned, do not order these in the summer.  No protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat, so I received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo!  The entire bag was liquid when I received it.  I love Haribo gummies, but will not order them in the summer ever again.  They were shipped with expedited shipping."
2316,B000EVMNMI,1,1311206400,These candies are not bursting with flavor.  I don't know if I just got a bad batch but they are rather bland.
2317,B000EVMNMI,1,1274745600,I thought this gummy candy would taste like cola - turns out it is citrus flavored and sour.  Not at all what I expected.
2318,B000EVMNMI,2,1183852800,"This particular batch was lacking the usual ""fizzy"" taste and texture.  However, they were sweet and chewy."
2319,B000CQBZV0,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
2320,B000CQBZV0,5,1252022400,"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
2321,B000CQBZV0,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
2322,B000CQBZV0,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2323,B000CQBZV0,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
2324,B000CQBZV0,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
2325,B000CQBZV0,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
2326,B000CQBZV0,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
2327,B000CQBZV0,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
2328,B000CQBZV0,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
2329,B000CQBZV0,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
2330,B000CQBZV0,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
2331,B000CQBZV0,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
2332,B000CQBZV0,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
2333,B000CQBZV0,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
2334,B000CQBZV0,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
2335,B000CQBZV0,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
2336,B000CQBZV0,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
2337,B000CQBZV0,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
2338,B000CQBZV0,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
2339,B000CQBZV0,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
2340,B000CQBZV0,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
2341,B000CQBZV0,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
2342,B000CQBZV0,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
2343,B000CQBZV0,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
2344,B000CQBZV0,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
2345,B000CQBZV0,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
2346,B000CQBZV0,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
2347,B000CQBZV0,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
2348,B000CQBZV0,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
2349,B000CQBZV0,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
2350,B000CQBZV0,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
2351,B000CQBZV0,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
2352,B000CQBZV0,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
2353,B000CQBZV0,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
2354,B000CQBZV0,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
2355,B000CQBZV0,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
2356,B000CQBZV0,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
2357,B000CQBZV0,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
2358,B000CQBZV0,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
2359,B000CQBZV0,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
2360,B000CQBZV0,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
2361,B000CQBZV0,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
2362,B000CQBZV0,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
2363,B000CQBZV0,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
2364,B000CQBZV0,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
2365,B000CQBZV0,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
2366,B000CQBZV0,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
2367,B000CQBZV0,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
2368,B000CQBZV0,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
2369,B000CQBZV0,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
2370,B000CQBZV0,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
2371,B000CQBZV0,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
2372,B000CQBZV0,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
2373,B000CQBZV0,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
2374,B000CQBZV0,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
2375,B000CQBZV0,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
2376,B000CQBZV0,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
2377,B000CQBZV0,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
2378,B000CQBZV0,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
2379,B000CQBZV0,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
2380,B000CQBZV0,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
2381,B000CQBZV0,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
2382,B000CQBZV0,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
2383,B000CQBZV0,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
2384,B000CQBZV0,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
2385,B000CQBZV0,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
2386,B000CQBZV0,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
2387,B000CQBZV0,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
2388,B000CQBZV0,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
2389,B000CQBZV0,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
2390,B000CQBZV0,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
2391,B000CQBZV0,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
2392,B000CQBZV0,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
2393,B000CQBZV0,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
2394,B000CQBZV0,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
2395,B000CQBZV0,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
2396,B000CQBZV0,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
2397,B000CQBZV0,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
2398,B000CQBZV0,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
2399,B000CQBZV0,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
2400,B000CQBZV0,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
2401,B000CQBZV0,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
2402,B000CQBZV0,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
2403,B000CQBZV0,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
2404,B000CQBZV0,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
2405,B000CQBZV0,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
2406,B000CQBZV0,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
2407,B000CQBZV0,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
2408,B000CQBZV0,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
2409,B000CQBZV0,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
2410,B000CQBZV0,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
2411,B000CQBZV0,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
2412,B000CQBZV0,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
2413,B000CQBZV0,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
2414,B000CQBZV0,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
2415,B000CQBZV0,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
2416,B000CQBZV0,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
2417,B000CQBZV0,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
2418,B000CQBZV0,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
2419,B000CQBZV0,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
2420,B003BGRUPI,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
2421,B003BGRUPI,5,1252022400,"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
2422,B003BGRUPI,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
2423,B003BGRUPI,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2424,B003BGRUPI,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
2425,B003BGRUPI,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
2426,B003BGRUPI,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
2427,B003BGRUPI,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
2428,B003BGRUPI,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
2429,B003BGRUPI,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
2430,B003BGRUPI,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
2431,B003BGRUPI,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
2432,B003BGRUPI,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
2433,B003BGRUPI,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
2434,B003BGRUPI,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
2435,B003BGRUPI,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
2436,B003BGRUPI,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
2437,B003BGRUPI,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
2438,B003BGRUPI,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
2439,B003BGRUPI,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
2440,B003BGRUPI,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
2441,B003BGRUPI,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
2442,B003BGRUPI,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
2443,B003BGRUPI,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
2444,B003BGRUPI,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
2445,B003BGRUPI,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
2446,B003BGRUPI,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
2447,B003BGRUPI,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
2448,B003BGRUPI,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
2449,B003BGRUPI,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
2450,B003BGRUPI,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
2451,B003BGRUPI,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
2452,B003BGRUPI,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
2453,B003BGRUPI,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
2454,B003BGRUPI,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
2455,B003BGRUPI,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
2456,B003BGRUPI,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
2457,B003BGRUPI,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
2458,B003BGRUPI,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
2459,B003BGRUPI,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
2460,B003BGRUPI,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
2461,B003BGRUPI,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
2462,B003BGRUPI,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
2463,B003BGRUPI,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
2464,B003BGRUPI,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
2465,B003BGRUPI,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
2466,B003BGRUPI,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
2467,B003BGRUPI,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
2468,B003BGRUPI,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
2469,B003BGRUPI,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
2470,B003BGRUPI,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
2471,B003BGRUPI,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
2472,B003BGRUPI,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
2473,B003BGRUPI,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
2474,B003BGRUPI,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
2475,B003BGRUPI,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
2476,B003BGRUPI,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
2477,B003BGRUPI,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
2478,B003BGRUPI,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
2479,B003BGRUPI,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
2480,B003BGRUPI,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
2481,B003BGRUPI,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
2482,B003BGRUPI,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
2483,B003BGRUPI,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
2484,B003BGRUPI,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
2485,B003BGRUPI,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
2486,B003BGRUPI,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
2487,B003BGRUPI,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
2488,B003BGRUPI,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
2489,B003BGRUPI,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
2490,B003BGRUPI,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
2491,B003BGRUPI,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
2492,B003BGRUPI,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
2493,B003BGRUPI,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
2494,B003BGRUPI,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
2495,B003BGRUPI,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
2496,B003BGRUPI,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
2497,B003BGRUPI,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
2498,B003BGRUPI,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
2499,B003BGRUPI,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
2500,B003BGRUPI,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
2501,B003BGRUPI,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
2502,B003BGRUPI,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
2503,B003BGRUPI,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
2504,B003BGRUPI,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
2505,B003BGRUPI,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
2506,B003BGRUPI,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
2507,B003BGRUPI,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
2508,B003BGRUPI,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
2509,B003BGRUPI,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
2510,B003BGRUPI,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
2511,B003BGRUPI,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
2512,B003BGRUPI,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
2513,B003BGRUPI,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
2514,B003BGRUPI,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
2515,B003BGRUPI,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
2516,B003BGRUPI,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
2517,B003BGRUPI,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
2518,B003BGRUPI,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
2519,B003BGRUPI,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
2520,B003BGRUPI,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
2521,B003CK7MME,5,1252713600,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
2522,B003CK7MME,5,1252022400,"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
2523,B003CK7MME,3,1333324800,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
2524,B003CK7MME,5,1306022400,"I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.<br />MY CO-WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2525,B003CK7MME,1,1300492800,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
2526,B003CK7MME,3,1275436800,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
2527,B003CK7MME,4,1260921600,"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought."
2528,B003CK7MME,5,1257552000,"I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over brew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem."
2529,B003CK7MME,3,1235088000,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
2530,B003CK7MME,3,1231200000,"The product is fine but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I was expecting Stash tea bags to contain the same beautiful chamomile flowers Stash sells as its loos Chamomile tea. Instead it looks they took a bunch chamomile leaves, chopped them up finally finely, and stuck them in a bag."
2531,B003CK7MME,1,1210982400,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
2532,B003CK7MME,5,1289433600,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
2533,B003CK7MME,5,1293148800,"For years I have been getting ""Miss Rona's"" Lavender tea.<br />However that company closed.<br />I've tried a couple of others that didn't come close.<br />This Stash Lavender tea is outstanding and relaxing."
2534,B003CK7MME,5,1154217600,"This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous."
2535,B003CK7MME,5,1163462400,"I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.  I wish it was less expensive, but feel it is worth it."
2536,B003CK7MME,5,1292025600,This is perfect for stressful moments to just take a break and enjoy some Tulsi goodness.  It helps me feel calm and relaxed - I really enjoy it and it's well worth a try.
2537,B003CK7MME,5,1232755200,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
2538,B003CK7MME,5,1222387200,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
2539,B003CK7MME,5,1155686400,"I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"
2540,B003CK7MME,5,1203897600,"*****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
2541,B003CK7MME,5,1220659200,The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.
2542,B003CK7MME,5,1289260800,"We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new ""favorite"" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish."
2543,B003CK7MME,5,1238371200,"This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do."
2544,B003CK7MME,4,1329696000,"I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender."
2545,B003CK7MME,2,1328313600,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
2546,B003CK7MME,5,1295308800,"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
2547,B003CK7MME,5,1264809600,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
2548,B003CK7MME,5,1259971200,This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.  Highly recommend.
2549,B003CK7MME,5,1257206400,"This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity."
2550,B003CK7MME,4,1253836800,The tea is good. Not that great. Has a spicy flavor to it. Not recommended for any one who is weak to caffeine because this tea is very strong.
2551,B003CK7MME,5,1242950400,"Stash Organic Breakfast Blend tea tastes great, and the free shipping and subscriber discount help make it more affordable. Recommend!"
2552,B003CK7MME,4,1236470400,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
2553,B003CK7MME,5,1234828800,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
2554,B003CK7MME,5,1234051200,"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
2555,B003CK7MME,5,1226188800,"We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful.  Great flavor, great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants.  A win/win for everyone!!! Highly recommended"
2556,B003CK7MME,5,1191801600,"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
2557,B003CK7MME,5,1327017600,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."
2558,B003CK7MME,1,1293148800,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."
2559,B003CK7MME,2,1325376000,"I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
2560,B003CK7MME,5,1323907200,Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit. Would order this tea again
2561,B003CK7MME,3,1316736000,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
2562,B003CK7MME,5,1309392000,"Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+"
2563,B003CK7MME,5,1305417600,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
2564,B003CK7MME,1,1303948800,"Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."
2565,B003CK7MME,5,1298332800,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
2566,B003CK7MME,1,1298073600,"I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."
2567,B003CK7MME,5,1294012800,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
2568,B003CK7MME,5,1286668800,"I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
2569,B003CK7MME,5,1274745600,I drink this tea after every dinner and it's very refreshing. The fact that it's organic makes its so much better. It only tastes good to me when it's hot though. When its cold or lukewarm it just tastes like toothpaste water.
2570,B003CK7MME,5,1273276800,I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..<br />it also adds a little yest when combining with other herbals. which I enjoy doing...
2571,B003CK7MME,5,1270684800,I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
2572,B003CK7MME,5,1253059200,This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
2573,B003CK7MME,5,1228521600,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended -  thanks for a wonderful product!"
2574,B003CK7MME,5,1215820800,"I'd never tried this before purchasing here, I love mints so I figured why not...I am so glad I did! This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one."
2575,B003CK7MME,5,1162425600,This is excellent tea..  I'm glad it's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste.  I orginally baught for my stomach but I'm taking a liking to the taste as well.  This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..
2576,B003CK7MME,4,1206403200,I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
2577,B003CK7MME,5,1350691200,"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
2578,B003CK7MME,5,1343347200,"I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!"
2579,B003CK7MME,5,1342742400,I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
2580,B003CK7MME,4,1341792000,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
2581,B003CK7MME,1,1338508800,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
2582,B003CK7MME,5,1337472000,"I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*"
2583,B003CK7MME,5,1332892800,"This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
2584,B003CK7MME,5,1327190400,I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
2585,B003CK7MME,5,1326412800,"Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing. Will order again. Very happy with this product.  Is good tasting, nice that its organic."
2586,B003CK7MME,5,1325721600,"I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil."
2587,B003CK7MME,5,1325548800,"I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend."
2588,B003CK7MME,5,1322697600,"THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality."
2589,B003CK7MME,5,1322611200,My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.  I make a cup for her every night.  You won't be disappointed!
2590,B003CK7MME,5,1317254400,A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
2591,B003CK7MME,4,1313280000,"This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.  I prefer with a little honey.  Very basis stuff."
2592,B003CK7MME,5,1308268800,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
2593,B003CK7MME,5,1307836800,"I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)"
2594,B003CK7MME,5,1307577600,Great tea: the delicious taste of Earl Grey (if you like the delicious taste of Earl Grey) with a (presumably) lower caffeine dose than the straight stuff.  Organic too.  Highly recommended.
2595,B003CK7MME,5,1306454400,"Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.  I can brew it as strong as I need it to be in the morning to give me that little extra oomph in the morning. I love Stash Organic tea, the English Breakfast Organic tea is also delicious."
2596,B003CK7MME,4,1305417600,Bolder ginger taste would earn a five stars hall of frame.  But being organic could make up for it.
2597,B003CK7MME,5,1302220800,"I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too."
2598,B003CK7MME,5,1301788800,The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.
2599,B003CK7MME,4,1301443200,"An amazing deal for an amazing tasting white tea! If you enjoy mint teas, you'll love this addition to your tea selection!"
2600,B003CK7MME,5,1299024000,"For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set."
2601,B003CK7MME,3,1298505600,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
2602,B003CK7MME,4,1294358400,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
2603,B003CK7MME,5,1292025600,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
2604,B003CK7MME,5,1291593600,"I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y"">Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>"
2605,B003CK7MME,5,1289952000,"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
2606,B003CK7MME,5,1284768000,"I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.<br /><br />I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.<br /><br />I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!"
2607,B003CK7MME,5,1284595200,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
2608,B003CK7MME,5,1283644800,This is one of my favorite teas. It has green tea but tastes only<br />like black tea. And it's organic. When I could no longer find it in<br />the stores near me I bought it through Amazon at a price less than<br />stores used to sell it for.
2609,B003CK7MME,5,1281830400,"This tea is crisp, clean, and fresh with the taste of lemon and ginger. No off-flavors. Get this one: you will enjoy every cup."
2610,B003CK7MME,5,1278720000,It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea. The green tea mellows it out. The spices are just right. Try it with a little sweetner and milk. Definitely better/healthier than highly sweetened mixes.
2611,B003CK7MME,5,1278460800,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
2612,B003CK7MME,1,1264809600,"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
2613,B003CK7MME,5,1260230400,Love this tea.  First time I ordered Chai Black Tea and it's marvelous.<br />I'm hooked.
2614,B003CK7MME,5,1252454400,"Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6"">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market."
2615,B003CK7MME,5,1251417600,This tea is excellent and we drink it all the time. It is well priced.
2616,B003CK7MME,5,1244505600,"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
2617,B003CK7MME,5,1242950400,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAG"">Stash Premium Organic Chamomile Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>because it does not taste like hay like most of the other chamomile teas I have tried.  I usually have it with a little honey.  Sometimes (especially if I have an upset stomach) I will brew it together with a mint tea bag.  The combination is good for settling the stomach.  I would highly recommend this product."
2618,B003CK7MME,5,1242432000,"All the Stashi products I have purchased are exceptionally good.  We<br />drink a lot of green and black teas, and have never had a bad Stashi<br />product.  I would recommend any of their teas for purchase.  You<br />won't go wrong."
2619,B003CK7MME,5,1232409600,Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.  If you like Chai tea you should try this.
2620,B003CK7MME,5,1203465600,"This is the tea that I can't start the day without.  My local grocery store is always running out, so I order through Amazon to make sure it's always there for me in the mornings!"
2621,B003CK7MME,5,1173052800,"I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull...doesn't even need any sugar, it's delicious as is."
